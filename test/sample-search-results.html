>Everyone you've ever known</a> is here.

<a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/8/">Every human</a> who has ever lived -- is here.

Pictured above is the 
<a href="ap080903.html">Earth-Moon system</a> as captured by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/introduction/">Cassini mission</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system">Solar System</a>.

Earth is the brighter and bluer of the 
<a href="ap100901.html">two spots</a> near the center, 
while the Moon is visible to its lower right.

Images of Earth from Saturn were taken on Friday.

Quickly released 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/rawimagedetails/index.cfm?imageID=294988"
>unprocessed images</a> were released Saturday showing several streaks that are not stars but rather

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"
>Saturn's</a> axis is tilted as it orbits the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun</a>, 
Saturn has <a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/
Sseason.htm">seasons</a>, like those of planet Earth ...
but Saturn's seasons last for over seven years.

<a href=
"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2001/15/image/a/">So what season</a> is it on Saturn now?

Orbiting the equator, the tilt of the
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html">rings
of Saturn</a> provides quite a graphic seasonal display.

Each year until 2016, Saturn's rings will be increasingly apparent
after appearing <a href="ap090904.html">nearly edge-on</a> in 2009.

The <a href="ap020215.html">ringed planet</a>
is also well placed in <a href=
"http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury">evening skies</a> providing a <a href=
"http://www.astronomerswithoutborders.org/tdtes-saturn-mosaic-project.html">grand view</a> 
as summer comes to <a href=
"http://www.universetoday.com/97128/changing-hues-signal-transition-of-seasons-at-saturn/">Saturn</a>'s northern 
hemisphere and winter to the south.

The Hubble Space Telescope took the above
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2001/15/">sequence
of images</a> about a year apart, starting on the
left in 1996 and ending on the right in 2000.  

Although they look solid, Saturn's Rings are likely
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984Sci...223..396Z"
>less than 50 meters thick</a> and
consist of individually orbiting bits of ice and rock ranging in size from grains of sand to barn-sized boulders.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/gallery.asp?
Gallery=Saturn&page=1">Take a picture</a> of Saturn
in the sky tonight.

You could capture a view like this one.

Recorded just last month looking toward the south,
planet Earth and ruins of the ancient
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Assos.jpg">temple of Athena</a> at
Assos, Turkey are in the foreground.

The Moon rises at the far left of the frame and
Saturn is the bright "star" at the upper right, near Virgo's
alpha star Spica
(<a href="image/1307/Assos2013AthenaMoonSaturn_tezel600lab.jpg">picture with
labels</a>).

If you do take a picture of Saturn or
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/waveatsaturn/">wave at Saturn</a>
and take a picture, you can
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/waveatsaturn/participating/">share
it online</a> and submit it to the
<a href="http://www.astronomerswithoutborders.org/
tdtes-saturn-mosaic-project.html">Saturn Mosaic Project</a>.

Why take a picture tonight?

Because the Cassini spacecraft will be
<a href="ap110904.html">orbiting Saturn</a> and
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/waveatsaturn/">taking a
picture of you.</a>

<a href=

An image from the 2005 pass,

>shown above</a> in false color, shows a remarkable world strewn with
strange craters and a

>generally odd surface</a>.   

The <a href="http://www.johnmunsch.com/images/FiveDifferences.png"
>slight differences</a> in color likely show differences in surface composition.   

At the bottom of most craters lies some type of
<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2010/pdf/1541.pdf"
>unknown dark material</a>.  

Inspection of the <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/hyperion/"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/
cassini20130429.html">Acquiring its first sunlit views</a>
of far northern
<a href="ap121204.html">Saturn late last year</a>, the
Cassini spacecraft's narrow-angle camera recorded this stunning image of
the vortex at the ringed planet's north pole.

<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/
pia14944.html">The false color, near-infrared image</a>
results in red hues for low
clouds and green for high ones, causing the north-polar hurricane to take
on the appearance of a rose.

Enormous by terrestrial hurricane standards, this storm's eye is
about 2,000 kilometers wide, with clouds at the outer edge
traveling at over 500 kilometers per hour.

The north pole Saturn hurricane swirls inside the large,
<a href="ap120122.html">six-sided weather pattern</a>
known as the hexagon.

Of course, in 2006 Cassini also imaged the hurricane at
<a href="ap061113.html">Saturn's south pole</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
It was one of the largest and longest lived storms ever recorded in our Solar System.  

First seen in late 2010, the <a href=
"http://www.ciclops.org/index/6967/The_Saturn_Storm_Chronicles"
>above cloud formation</a> in the northern hemisphere of Saturn started larger than the Earth and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7O8Hsuxjyo"
>soon spread</a> completely around the planet.

The storm was tracked not only
<a href="ap110317.html">from Earth</a> but from
<a href="ap110119.html">up close</a> by the robotic
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Saturn.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12829"
>Pictured above</a> in false colored infrared in February, orange colors indicate
<a href="ap110708.html">clouds deep</a> in the atmosphere, while light colors highlight clouds higher up.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn"
>rings of Saturn</a> are seen nearly edge-on as the thin blue horizontal line.

The warped dark bands are the
<a href="ap111012.html">shadows of the rings</a> cast onto the cloud tops by the Sun to the upper left.

A source of radio noise from
<a href="ap100419.html">lightning</a>, the
<a href="ap080505.html">intense storm</a> was thought to relate to seasonal changes when spring
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW0EsR2FBD4"
>emerges</a> in the north of  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvTSB5B0d0w">Saturn</a>.

After raging for over six months, the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Icar..223..460S"
>iconic storm</a> circled the entire planet and then tried to absorb its own tail -- which surprisingly caused it to <a href=
"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20130131.html"
>fade away</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Just days after sharing the western evening sky
<a href="ap070523.html">with Venus</a> in 2007, the Moon moved
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/">on to Saturn</a> -
actually passing in
front of the ringed planet Saturn when viewed in skies over
Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.

Because the Moon and bright planets wander through the sky
near the <a href="ap001014.html">ecliptic plane</a>, such
<a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/planets/
planets.htm">occultation events</a> are
not uncommon, but they are
<a href="ap030724.html">dramatic</a>, especially in
telescopic views.

For example, in this sharp image Saturn is captured
<a href=
"http://www.tamanti.it/Solar%20Sys/SaturnOccultation.htm">emerging
from</a> behind the Moon, giving the illusion
that it lies just beyond the Moon's bright edge.

Of course, the Moon is a mere 400 thousand kilometers away,
compared to Saturn's distance of 1.4
<a href="http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp">billion</a> kilometers.

Taken with a digital camera and 20 inch diameter telescope
at the <a href="http://www.sternwarte-weikersheim.de/about/
about_set.html">Weikersheim Observatory</a> in southern Germany,
the picture is a single exposure adjusted to reduce the
difference in brightness between Saturn and the
cratered lunar surface.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why would clouds form a hexagon on Saturn?

Nobody is sure.   

Originally discovered during the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager</a> flybys of 
Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen anything like it anywhere else in the 
<a href="http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/">Solar System</a>. 

If Saturn's South Pole wasn't strange enough with its 
<a href="ap121204.html">rotating vortex</a>, 
Saturn's North Pole might be considered even stranger.  

The bizarre cloud pattern is 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14646">shown above</a> 
in great detail by a recent image taken by the 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?saturn">Saturn</a>-orbiting 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/">Cassini spacecraft</a>.

This and similar images show the stability of the 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hexagon.html">hexagon</a> 
even 20+ years after Voyager.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09187">Movies</a> 
of Saturn's North Pole show the cloud structure maintaining its 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon"
>hexagonal structure</a> while rotating.  

Unlike individual clouds appearing like a 
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=3350">hexagon on Earth</a>, 
the Saturn 
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070327.html"
>cloud pattern</a> appears to have 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2471.html"
>six well defined sides</a> of nearly equal length.

Four 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0610/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg"
>Earth</a>s could fit inside the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">hexagon</a>.

Imaged from the side, the 
<a href="ap101012.html">dark shadow</a> of the

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
What do Saturn's rings look like from the dark side?  

From Earth, we usually see Saturn's rings from the same side
of the ring plane that the Sun illuminates them -- one might call this the bright side.

Geometrically, in the
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14636">above picture</a> taken in August by the
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/1979.html"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>,
the Sun is behind the camera but on the
<I>other side</I> of the ring plane.

Such a vantage point gives a
<a href="ap050211.html">breathtaking view</a>s of the most
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>splendid ring system</a> in the Solar System.

Strangely, the rings have similarities to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)"
>photographic negative</a> of a front view.

For example, the dark band in the middle is actually the
<a href="ap040723.html">normally bright B-ring</a>.

The ring brightness as recorded from different angles
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001DPS....33.2901P"
>indicates</a> ring thickness and particle density of ring particles. 

At the top left of the frame is Saturn's moon
<a href="ap091208.html">Tethys</a>, which although harder to find, contains much more mass than the  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnApR8fdKRo">entire ring system</a>.

<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/
cassini20121218.html">Splendors seldom seen</a>
are revealed in this glorious picture from
Saturn's shadow.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14934">Imaged
by Cassini</a> on October 17, 2012 during its 174th orbit,
the ringed planet's night side is viewed
from a perspective 19 degrees below the ring plane at a distance
of about 800,000 kilometers with the Sun almost directly behind
the planet.

A 60 frame mosaic, images made with infrared, red, and violet filters
were combined to create an enhanced, false-color view.

Strongly backlit, the rings look bright away from the planet
but dark in silhouette against the gas giant.

Above center, they reflect a faint, eerie light on the cloud tops while
<a href="ap070306.html">Saturn casts</a> its own dark shadow on the rings.

<a href="ap110904.html">A similar Cassini</a> image from 2006 also
featured planet Earth as a pale blue dot in the distance.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
What's happening at the north pole of Saturn?

A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6HpgyTVRYY">vortex</a> 
of strange and complex swirling clouds. 

The center of this vortex was

>Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn. 

These clouds lie at the center of the unusual 
<a href="ap120122.html">hexagonal cloud system</a> that surrounds the north pole of Saturn.

The sun rose on Saturn's north pole just a few years ago, 
with Cassini taking only 
<a href="ap070403.html">infrared images</a> of the shadowed region previously.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why is this moon shaped like a smooth egg?

The robotic Cassini spacecraft completed the first flyby ever of Saturn's small moon 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/methone/">Methone</a> 
in May and discovered that the moon has no obvious craters.

Craters, usually caused by impacts, have been seen on every 
<a href="ap070225.html">moon</a>, 
<a href="ap100726.html">asteroid, and comet nucleus</a> 
ever imaged in detail -- until now. 

Even the <a href="ap990711.html">Earth</a> and 
<a href="ap041124.html">Titan</a> have 
<a href="ap971110.html">craters</a>.

The smoothness and egg-like shape of the 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/05211206.html"
>3-kilometer diameter moon</a> might be caused by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methone_%28moon%29">Methone</a>'s 
surface being able to shift -- 
something that might occur were the moon coated by a deep 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzyettXkIqY">pile</a> of sub-visual 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile">rubble</a>.

If so, the most similar objects in our Solar System would include Saturn's moons 
<a href="ap060222.html">Telesto</a>, 
<a href="ap051123.html">Pandora</a>, 
<a href="ap100217.html">Calypso</a>, as well as asteroid 
<a href="ap070422.html">Itokawa</a>, 
all of which show sections that are unusually smooth.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why does one half of Dione have more craters than the other?

Start with the fact that 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moon Dione 
has one side that always faces Saturn, and one side that always faces away.  

This is similar to 
<a href="ap051113.html">Earth's Moon</a>.

This <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal locking</a> 
means that one side of 
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Dione"
>Dione</a> always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit, 
while the other side always trails.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29">Dione</a> 
should therefore have undergone a significant number of impacts on its leading half.

Strangely, the current leading half of 
<a href="ap060905.html">Dione</a> 
is <i>less</i> cratered than the trailing half.  

A leading explanation is that some crater-forming impacts were so large they spun 
<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2034.pdf">Dione</a>, 
changing the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the 
moon's spin again became locked.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
How old are Saturn's rings?  

No one is quite sure. 

One possibility is that the rings formed relatively recently in our
Solar System's history, perhaps only about 100 million years ago when
a moon-sized object 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">broke up</a> near Saturn.  

Evidence for a young ring age includes a basic 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133..656V">stability
analysis for rings</a>, 
and the fact that the rings are so bright and
relatively unaffected by numerous small dark 
<a href="ap011118.html">meteor</a> impacts.  

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-149">More recent 
evidence</a>, however, raises the possibility that some of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings">Saturn's rings</a> 
may be billions of years old and so almost as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment">old</a> as Saturn itself.   

Inspection of images by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft
indicates that some of 
<a href="ap040723.html">Saturn's ring</a> particles temporarily
bunch and collide, effectively recycling 
<a href="ap071024.html">ring</a> particles by bringing
fresh bright ices to the surface.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09788">Seen here</a>, 
Saturn's rings were imaged in their true colors by the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">robotic
Cassini</a> in late October.  

Icy bright <a href="ap070909.html">Tethys</a>, 
a moon of Saturn likely brightened by a sandblasting 
<a href="ap071013.html">rain of ice</a> from sister moon 
<a href="ap060310.html">Enceladus</a>, is visible in front of
the darker rings.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Humanity's  robot orbiting Saturn has recorded yet another amazing view.

That robot, of course, is the 
<a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31385"
>spacecraft Cassini</a>, while the new amazing view includes a 
<a href="ap090505.html">bright moon</a>, 
<a href="ap051219.html">thin rings</a>, 
<a href="ap050225.html">oddly broken clouds</a>, and 
<a href="ap120304.html">warped</a> shadows.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28moon%29">Titan</a>, Saturn's largest moon,
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMYIPAXH3H_index_1.html">appears above</a> 
as a featureless tan as it is continually shrouded in thick clouds.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn">rings of Saturn</a> 
are seen as a thin line because they are so flat and imaged nearly edge on.

Details of Saturn's rings are therefore best visible in the 
<a href="ap101012.html">dark ring shadows</a> seen across the giant planet's cloud tops.

Since the ring 
<a href="http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dog-mess.jpeg">particles</a> 
orbit in the same plane as Titan, they appear to skewer the foreground moon.

In the upper hemisphere of Saturn, the clouds show many details, including 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14916">dips</a> in long bright bands 
indicating disturbances in a high altitude jet stream.

Recent precise measurements of how much Titan 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15606">flexes</a> as it orbits Saturn hint that 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20120628/">vast oceans</a> 
of water <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaHiOMlsToQ">might exist</a> deep underground.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Known for its bright <a href="ap071217.html">ring</a>
system and many <a href="ap071010.html">moons</a>, gas giant
Saturn looks strange and unfamiliar in this false-color
view from the Cassini spacecraft.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08732">In fact,
in this</a> Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer
(<a href="http://wwwvims.lpl.arizona.edu/">VIMS</a>)

The most striking contrast in the image is
along the terminator or boundary between night and day.

To the right (day side) blue-green hues
are visible sunlight reflected from Saturn's cloud tops.

But on the left (night side) in the absence of sunlight, the
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/

What's that past Dione?

When making its closest pass yet of Saturn's moon 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29">Dione</a> 
late last year, the robotic Cassini spacecraft snapped this far-ranging picture featuring Dione, Saturn's rings, and the two small moons 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_%28moon%29">Epimetheus</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_%28moon%29">Prometheus</a>.

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14590">above image</a> 
captures part of the heavily cratered snow-white surface of the 1,100 kilometer wide 
<a href="ap111026.html">Dione</a>, the thinness of Saturn's rings, and the 
<a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kYj867JeEVY/0.jpg">comparative darkness</a> 
of the smaller moon <a href="ap080211.html">Epimetheus</a>. 

The image was taken when Cassini was only about 100,000 kilometers from the 
<a href="ap070801.html">large icy moon</a>.

Future events in Cassini's

How many moons does Saturn have?

<a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_discovery">So far 62 have

Six of its largest satellites can be seen here, though, in a sharp

Larger than Earth's Moon and even slightly larger than Mercury,
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/
profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Titan">Titan</a>
has a diameter of 5,150 kilometers and starts the line-up

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
This moon is shining by the light of its planet.

Specifically, a large portion of Enceladus 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00003360/">pictured above</a> 
is illuminated primarily by sunlight first reflected from the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/index.cfm?SciencePageID=51"
>planet Saturn</a>.

The result is that the normally 
<a href="ap050317.html">snow-white</a> moon appears in the gold color of 
<a href="ap060503.html">Saturn's cloud tops</a>.  

As most of the illumination comes from the image left, a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth">labyrinth</a> of ridges throws notable shadows just to the right of the image center, while the kilometer-deep canyon 
<a href="ap081222.html">Labtayt Sulci</a> is visible just below.

The bright thin crescent on the far right is the only part of 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fpErxgWzQ">Enceladus</a> 
directly lit by the Sun.

<b> Explanation: </b>
Believe it or not, this is the North Pole of Saturn.

It is unclear how
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11682"
>an unusual hexagonal cloud system</a> that surrounds
Saturn's north pole was created, keeps its shape, or how long it will last.

Originally discovered during the
<a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager</a>
flybys of Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=3350"
>anything like it</a> elsewhere in the Solar System.

Although its

>Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn, in 2009 the mysterious

>hexagonal vortex</a> became fully illuminated by sunlight for the
<a href="ap090930.html">first time</a> during the Cassini's visit.

Since then, Cassini has imaged the
<a href="http://www.clickmazes.com/spin/ixspin.htm">rotating hexagon</a>
in visible light enough times to create a

The pole center was not well imaged and has been excluded.

This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZAI1LkFlVg"

such as waves emanating from the corners of the hexagon.

<b> Explanation: </b>
A fourth moon is visible on the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14579">above image</a> 
if you look hard enough.

First -- and farthest in the background -- is 
<a href="ap110401.html">Titan</a>, the largest moon of Saturn and one of the larger moons in the Solar System.  

The dark feature across the top of this perpetually cloudy world is the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=3689"
>north polar hood</a>.

The next most obvious moon is bright 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29">Dione</a>, 
visible in the foreground, complete with craters and long 
<a href="ap060905.html">ice cliffs</a>.

Jutting in from the left are several of Saturn's 
<a href="ap050525.html">expansive rings</a>, 
including Saturn's A ring featuring the dark 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encke_Division#Encke_Gap">Encke Gap</a>.

On the far right, just outside the rings, is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_%28moon%29">Pandora</a>, 
a moon only 80-kilometers across that 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdUlpeUFfxI">helps shepherd</a>

The fourth moon?  

If you look closely in the Encke Gap you'll find a speck that is actually 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_%28moon%29">Pan</a>.

Although one of Saturn's smallest moons at 35-kilometers across, Pan is massive enough to help keep the

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Saturn's rings form one of the larger sundials known.

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial">sundial</a>, however, determines only the 
<a href="ap030405.html">season</a> of Saturn, not the time of day.

In 2009, during 
<a href="ap090825.html">Saturn's last equinox</a>, Saturn's thin rings threw 
<a href="ap091110.html">almost no shadows</a> onto Saturn, since the ring plane pointed directly toward the Sun.

As Saturn continued in its orbit around the Sun, however, the ring shadows become increasingly wider and cast further south. 

These shadows are not easily visible from the Earth because from our vantage point near the Sun, the rings 
<a href="http://addictedtoinsight.com/aihome/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frustration1.png">always block</a> the shadows.

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14576"
>above image</a> was taken in August by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/"
>robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Saturn.

The rings themselves appear as a vertical bar on the image right.

The Sun, far to the upper right, shines through the rings and casts captivatingly 
<a href="ap101012.html">complex shadows</a> on south Saturn, on the image left.

Cassini has been 
<a href="ap110613.html">exploring Saturn</a>, 
its rings, and its moons since 2004, and is 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20100203/"

These tantalizing panoramas follow a remarkable

Saturns_Giant_Northern_Storm">giant storm encircling</a>
the northern hemisphere of
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/
profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&Display=OverviewLong">ringed planet Saturn</a>.

Still active, the
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/
newsrelease20110706/">roiling storm clouds</a> were captured in
near-infrared images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft
on February 26 and stitched into
the high resolution, false-color mosaics.

<a href="http://www.alpo-astronomy.org/saturnblog/?p=31">Seen
late last year</a> as a prominent bright spot
by amateur astronomers when Saturn rose
in predawn skies, the powerful storm
<a href="ap110317.html">has grown</a>
to enormous proportions.

Its north-south extent is nearly 15,000 kilometers and
it now stretches completely around the
gas giant's northern hemisphere some 300,000 kilometers.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12825">Taken
about one Saturn day</a> (11 hours) apart, the panoramas show the head

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What has the Cassini orbiter seen since arriving at Saturn?

The <a href="http://vimeo.com/24410924">above music video</a>
shows some of the highlights.

In the first time-lapse sequence (00:07), a vertical line appears that is really Saturn's
<a href="ap110308.html">thin rings</a> seen nearly edge-on.  

Soon some of
<a href="http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=18015">Saturn</a>'s
moon shoot past.  

The next sequence (00:11) features Saturn's unusually
<a href="ap100802.html">wavy F-ring</a> that is constrained by the two
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdUlpeUFfxI">shepherd moons</a> that are also continually perturbing it.  

Soon much of Saturn's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn">extensive ring system</a> flashes by, sometimes juxtaposed to the grandeur of the immense planet itself.

Cloud patterns on
<a href="ap060215.html">Titan</a> (00:39) and
<a href="ap050225.html">Saturn</a> (00:41) are highlighted.

Clips from flyby's of several of Saturn's moon are then shown, including

In other sequences, moons of Saturn
<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0701/ringcross_cassini.gif"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Late last year, a new, remarkably
<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/
112507364.html">bright storm erupted</a> in
Saturn's northern hemisphere.

Nicknamed "the Serpent Storm", the northern hemisphere disturbance
is still going strong and now
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002946/">circles
far around</a> the planet.

Offering spectacular
<a href="ap110119.html">space-based views</a> to the Saturn-orbiting
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/">Cassini spacecraft</a>,
the storm shows enough contrast with the banded
cloud tops to be visible with even modest ground-based
equipment, as seen in
<a href="http://www.bcastropics.com/images/view/414">this sharp image</a>
from Buena Vista, Georgia, USA, planet Earth.

<a href="http://alpo-j.asahikawa-med.ac.jp/Latest/Saturn.htm">Amateur
astronomers</a> first spotted the bright storm in early December 2010,
with the ringed gas giant rising in predawn skies, and
<a href="http://saturn.cstoneind.com/">continue to monitor</a>
the storm's progress.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What would it look like to approach Saturn in a spaceship?

One doesn't have to just imagine -- the
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/">Cassini spacecraft</a>
did just this in 2004,  recording thousands of images along the way, and
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/">thousands more</a> since entering orbit.

Recently, some of these images have been digitally tweaked, cropped, and compiled into the
<a href="http://vimeo.com/11386048">above inspiring video</a> which is part of a larger developing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imax">IMAX</a> movie project named
<a href="http://www.outsideinthemovie.com/">Outside In</a>.  

In the last sequence, Saturn looms increasingly large on approach as
<a href="ap090505.html">cloudy Titan</a> swoops below.

With Saturn whirling around in the background, Cassini is next depicted flying over
<a href="ap090517.html">Mimas</a>, with large
<a href="ap100511.html">Herschel Crater</a> clearly visible.

Saturn's majestic rings then take over the show as Cassini crosses Saturn's
<a href="http://ringoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pac-man-ring.jpg"
>thin ring</a> plane.

Dark shadows of the ring appear on
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11141">Saturn itself</a>.

Finally, the enigmatic ice-geyser moon
<a href="ap090628.html">Enceladus</a> appears in the
distance and then is approached just as the video clip ends.

<b> Explanation: </b>
How thin are the rings of Saturn?  

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997Icar..129..555B"
>Brightness measurements</a> from different angles have shown 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/rings.html">Saturn's rings</a> 
to be about one kilometer thick, making them many times thinner, 
in relative proportion, than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"
>razor blade</a>.  

This thinness <a href="ap051021.html">sometimes appears</a> in 
<a href="ap950801.html">dramatic fashion</a> 
during an image taken nearly along the ring plane.  

The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/spacecraft/index.html"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting <a href=
"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn">Saturn</a>

<a href="ap060508.html">Titan</a> looms just over the thin rings, 
while dark 
<a href="ap100215.html">ring shadows</a> on Saturn show the Sun to be above the

<a href="http://alpo-j.asahikawa-med.ac.jp/Latest/Saturn.htm">Amateur

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What's creating those dark bands on Saturn?  

Sometimes it takes a little
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No._1_Ladies%27_Detective_Agency"
>sleuthing</a> to figure out the how and why of a
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12734"
>picture</a> taken by the Saturn-orbiting
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/spacecraft/index.html"
>Cassini</a> spacecraft.  

Let's see.  That large orb on the left must be
<a href="ap090930.html">Saturn</a> itself.

Those arcs on the right are surely the
<a href="ap071024.html">rings</a>.  

The dark band running diagonally must be the shadow of Saturn on the rings.

That leaves the unusual dark bands superposed on Saturn's disk -- are they the shadows of the rings?  

A <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/punctilious">punctilious</a> detective would conclude that they are not.

If one looks carefully, the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UCCHjoQrM"
>rings arc</a> from behind the planet on the lower left, around to the right, and therefore must pass on the camera side of the planet on the upper left.

So the rings themselves cause the dark streaks on Saturn.

These rings segments appear dark because they are
<a href="ap090111.html">in the shadow of Saturn</a>.  

The night part of Saturn shows a faint glow because of sunlight reflected from other parts of the rings.  

<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/06/saturn-brain-bender/">Got it?</a>  

Unfortunately, if it weren't for the tile floor,
tomorrow's picture would be even harder to understand.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What drives auroras on Saturn?

To help find out, scientists have sorted through hundreds of infrared images of 
<a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a> taken by the 
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEMD6E2VQUD_0.html"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> for other purposes, trying to find enough aurora images to correlate changes and make 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzwiTspxtrg">movies</a>.

Once made, some movies clearly show that 
<a href="ap081119.html">Saturnian auroras</a> can change not only with the angle of the Sun, but also as the planet rotates.

Furthermore, some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AmyfuJDMlY"
>auroral changes</a> appear related to waves in Saturn's 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a> likely caused by Saturn's moons.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13402">Pictured above</a>, a false-colored image taken in 2007 shows Saturn in three bands of infrared light.  

The <a href="ap070627.html">rings reflect</a> relatively blue sunlight, while the planet itself glows in comparatively low energy red.  

A band of <a href="ap050222.html">southern aurora</a> in visible in green.

Inspection of many more Saturnian images may well lead to an even better understanding of both Saturn's and 
<a href="ap100701.html">Earth's auroras</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What's causing those strange dark streaks in the rings of Saturn?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(moon)">Prometheus</a>.  

Specifically, an orbital dance involving
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/prometheus.html"
>Saturn's moon Prometheus</a> keeps creating unusual light and dark streamers in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings#F_Ring">F-Ring</a> of Saturn.

Now <a href="ap041217.html">Prometheus</a> orbits Saturn just inside the thin
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/rings.html"
>F-ring</a>, but ventures into its inner edge about every 15 hours.

Prometheus' gravity then
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JdzjXlvBYE">pulls the closest
ring particles</a> toward the 80-km moon.  

The result is not only a stream of bright
<a href="ap050525.html">ring particles</a> but also a
<a href="ap081208.html">dark ribbon</a> where ring particles used to be.  

Since <a href=
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKhYSv3FZP4">Prometheus</a>
orbits faster than the ring particles, the icy moon pulls out a new streamer every pass.  

Above, several streamers or <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prometheus_tugging_on_F_Ring_PIA09909.jpg">kinks</a> are visible at once.

The <a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view/6411/Fleeing_the_Scene?js=1">above

<b> Explanation: </b>

What's happened to that moon of Saturn?

Nothing -- Saturn's moon Rhea is just partly hidden behind Saturn's rings.

In April, the robotic Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn took this
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12643"
>narrow-angle view</a> looking across the
<a href="http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/en/kids/sse_flipflop.shtml"
>Solar System</a>'s most
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings">famous rings</a>.

Rings visible in the foreground include the thin
<a href="ap090427.html">F ring</a> on the outside and the much wider
<a href="ap071024.html">A and B rings</a> just interior to it.

Although it seems to be hovering
<a href="ap071217.html">over the rings</a>, Saturn's moon
<a href="ap061107.html">Janus</a> is actually far behind them.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus">Janus</a> is one of
Saturn's smaller
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdciFqa7xM0">moons</a>
and measures only about 180 kilometers across.

Farther out from the camera is the heavily cratered
<a href="ap060530.html">Rhea</a>, a much larger moon
measuring 1,500 kilometers across.

The top of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G_-v4JVyAA"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Why is this giant crater on Mimas oddly colored?

<a href="ap090517.html">Mimas</a>, one of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn"
>smaller round moons</a> of Saturn, sports 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_%28crater_on_Mimas%29"
>Herschel crater</a>, one of the larger impact craters in the entire Solar System.

The robotic 
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/spacecraft/index.html"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn took the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12572"
>above image</a> of Herschel crater in unprecedented detail while making a 10,000-kilometer record close pass by the 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwWBZFIBkr0">icy world</a> 
just over one month ago.

Shown in contrast-enhanced false color, the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12572"
>above image</a> includes color information from older 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CHHPHZIIMs">Mimas</a> images that together show more clearly that Herschel's landscape is colored slightly differently from more 
<a href="ap070225.html">heavily cratered terrain</a> nearby.  

The color difference could yield surface composition clues to the violent history of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_%28moon%29">Mimas</a>.  

An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater">impact</a> 
on Mimas much larger than the one that created the 130-kilometer Herschel would likely have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r2_RD5SQN0&NR"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What would it be like to see a sky with many moons?  

Such is the sky above
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/">Saturn</a>.  

When appearing close to each other, moons will show a similar
<a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html">phase</a>.

A view with two of the more famous moons of
<a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> in gibbous
<a href="ap040829.html">phase</a> was captured last month by the
<a href="http://aispace.org/robot/">robot</a> spacecraft

>Cassini</a> now orbiting Saturn.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28moon%29">Titan</a>,
on the left, is among the largest moons in the
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html"
>Solar System</a> and is perpetually shrouded in clouds.  

In 2005, the Huygens probe

and gave humanity its first view of its unusual surface.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_(moon)">Dione</a>,

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Why is this moon of Saturn so smooth?

This past weekend, humanity's Saturn-orbiting
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/introduction/">Cassini</a> spacecraft
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturntourdates/saturntourdates2010/"
>passed</a> as close to Saturn's small moon
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGbx7_GHXfw"
>Calypso</a> as it ever has, and imaged the small moon in unprecedented detail.

<a href="http://ciclops.org/view/6204/Calypso_Rev_126_Flyby_Raw_Preview_1"
>Pictured above</a> is an early return, raw, unprocessed image of the 20-km long irregularly shaped moon.

Like its sister moon
<a href="ap060222.html">Telesto</a> and the shepherd moon
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(moon)">Pandor</a><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Avatar"
>a</a>, Calypso has shown itself to be unusually smooth,
much smoother than most of Saturn's larger moons.

A leading hypothesis for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_(moon)"
>Calypso</a>'s smoothness is that much of the moon's surface is actually a relatively loose jumble of rubble -- making
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002345/">Calypso</a>
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile">rubble-pile</a> moon.  

The loose nature of the small
<a href="ap070422.html">ice pieces</a>
allows them to fill in many small craters and other surface features.

Calypso orbits Saturn always behind Saturn's much larger moon
<a href="ap091208.html">Tethys</a>, whereas
Telesto's orbit always precedes Tethys.

Calypso's extremely white surface -- not unlike
<a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/individual.php?db_date=2010-02-10"
>fresh snow</a> -- may result from the
continuous accumulation of fresh ice particles falling in from
<a href="ap070327.html">Saturn's E ring</a>.

<A HREF=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100215.html><img alt="Thumbnail image of picture found for this day." src=/apod/calendar/S_100215.jpg></A><A HREF=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100215.html> APOD: 2010 February 15 - Cassini Spacecraft Crosses Saturn's Ring Plane   
</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
If this is Saturn, where are the rings?  

When Saturn's "appendages" 
<a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">disappeared</a> 
in 1612, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html"
>Galileo</a> did not understand why.   

Later that century, it became understood that 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>'s unusual protrusions were rings and that when the 
<a href="ap950801.html">Earth crosses the ring plane</a>, 
the edge-on rings will appear to disappear.  

This is because Saturn's rings are confined to a <a href=
"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_kids/AskKids/saturnrings.shtml"
>plane many times thinner</a>, in proportion, than a 

<a href="http://www.quikshave.com/timeline.htm">razor blade</a>.  

In modern times, the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn now also crosses 
<a href="ap040117.html">Saturn's ring</a> plane.  

A series of plane crossing images from 2005 February 
was dug out of the vast 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/index.cfm"
>online Cassini raw image</a> archive by interested Spanish amateur 
Fernando Garcia Navarro.  

Pictured above, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, 
is the striking result.  

<a href="ap080720.html">Saturn's thin ring plane</a> 
appears in blue, bands and clouds in 
<a href="ap041102.html">Saturn's upper atmosphere</a> 
appear in gold.

Since Saturn just 
<a href="ap091110.html">passed its equinox</a>, today the ring plane is pointed close to the Sun and the rings could not cast the high 
<a href="ap090901.html">dark shadows</a> seen across the top of this image, taken back in 2005.

Moons appear as bumps in the rings.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What processes formed the unusual surface of Saturn's moon Tethys?

To help find out,
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/index.html">NASA</a>
sent the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini–Huygens">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> right past the enigmatic ice moon in 2005.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07738">Pictured above</a> is one of the highest resolution images of an entire face of Tethys yet created.

The pervasive white color of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NTM6B1H0h8"
>Tethys</a> is thought to be created by
fresh ice particles continually falling onto the moon from Saturn's diffuse
<a href="ap070327.html">E-ring</a> -- particles expelled by Saturn's moon
<a href="ap090628.html">Enceladus</a>.

Some of the unusual cratering patterns on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_(moon)">Tethys</a>
remain less well understood, however.  

Close inspection of the
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07738">above image</a>
of Tethys' south pole will reveal a
<a href="ap080624.html">great rift</a> running diagonally down from the middle:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Chasma">Ithaca Chasma</a>.

A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7297408.stm"
>leading theory</a> for the creation of this
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007GeoRL..3421203G"
>great canyon</a> is anchored in the tremendous moon-wide surface cracking that
likely occurred when
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBJsSb9Nwc"
>Tethys</a>' internal oceans froze.

If so, Tethys may once have
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/">harbored</a>
internal oceans, possibly similar to the underground oceans some hypothesize to exist under the
<a href="ap091124.html">surface of Enceladus</a> today.

Might ancient <a href="ap040404.html">life</a> be frozen down there?

The other side of Saturn's ring plane is now directly illuminated by the Sun.

For the previous 15 years, the southern side of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>
and its rings were directly illuminated, but since
<a href="ap090901.html">Saturn's equinox</a> in August,
the orientation has reversed.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12318"
>Pictured above</a> last month, the robotic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini–Huygens"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn

Imaged from nearly behind, Saturn and its moon
<a href="ap041129.html">Tethys</a> each show a crescent phase to
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturntourdates/"
>Cassini</a> that is not visible from Earth.

As the rings continue to point nearly toward the Sun, only a
<a href="ap090930.html">thin shadow of Saturn's rings</a>
is visible across the center of the planet.  

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9Ot4ymMeQ&NR=1"
>Close inspection</a> of Saturn's rings, however, shows superposed bright features identified as
<a href="ap090602.html">spokes</a> that are thought to be groups of very small electrically charged ice particles.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What has created a large dust ring around Saturn?

At over 200 times the radius of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>
and over 50 times the radius of Saturn's expansive
<a href="ap070327.html">E ring</a>, the
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08515.pdf"
>newly discovered dust ring</a> is the largest planetary ring yet imaged.

The <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/07/spitzer-sees-giant-ring-around-saturn/">ring</a> was found in infrared light by the Earth-trailing 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_space_telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.  

A leading hypothesis for its origin is impact material ejected from Saturn's moon
<a href="ap060212.html">Phoebe</a>, which orbits right through the <a href=
"http://www.astro.virginia.edu/pom/archive.php?year=2009&month=10"
>dust ring</a>'s middle.  

An additional possibility is that the
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/spitzer-20091007v.html"
>dust ring</a> supplies the
mysterious material that coats part of Saturn's moon
<a href="ap090809.html">Iapetus</a>, which orbits near the

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
How would Saturn look if its ring plane pointed right at the Sun?

Before last month, nobody knew.  

Every 15 years, as seen from Earth,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn">Saturn's rings</a>
point toward the Earth and
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/us/saturn-s-rings-are-still-a-very-strange-wonder-and-a-source-of-surprises.html"
>appear to disappear</a>.

The <a href="ap090904.html">disappearing rings</a> are no longer a mystery -- Saturn's rings are known to be
<a href="ap051219.html">so thin</a> and the
<a href="ap090111.html">Earth is so near the Sun</a>
that when the rings point toward the Sun, they also point
<a href="ap090428.html">nearly edge-on</a> at the Earth.

Fortunately, in this
<a href="ap010101.html">third millennium</a>, humanity is advanced enough to have a spacecraft that can see the rings
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002044/">during equinox</a>
from the side.

Last month, that Saturn-orbiting spacecraft,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini–Huygens">Cassini</a>,
was able to snap a series of unprecedented pictures of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1_SgVFpjBU"
>Saturn's rings during equinox</a>.

A digital composite of 75 such images is
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11667">shown above</a>.

The rings appear <a href="ap090901.html">unusually dark</a>, and a very thin ring shadow line can be made out on Saturn's cloud-tops.  

Objects sticking out of the ring plane are
<a href="ap090825.html">brightly illuminated</a> and cast
<a href="ap090415.html">long shadows</a>.  

Inspection of these images may help
humanity understand the specific
<a href="ap050525.html">sizes of Saturn's ring particles</a> and the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Icar..166..320G">general dynamics</a>

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Today, planet Earth passes through the plane of
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/
rings.html">Saturn's rings</a>.

From the perspective of
<a href="ap090304.html">earthbound astronomers</a>, Saturn's rings
will be edge-on.

The problem is,
<a href="http://nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn itself</a>
is now very close to the Sun, low on
horizon after sunset, so good telescopic images will be difficult
to come by.

Still,
<a href="http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/
6yearsofsaturn.html">this composite of Saturn views</a>
taken from 2004 - 2009 (lower right to upper left) illustrates
<a
href="http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/
6_years_of_saturn.html">the change</a> in ring tilt
over the last six years and includes a nearly edge-on
ring view, based on images captured earlier this year.

While Saturn's <a href="ap061113.html">south pole</a> is clearly
seen in the sequence,
particularly at the lower right, it will be hidden in the coming
years.

Saturn's <a href="ap070403.html">north pole</a> will be increasingly
visible, along with
the tilting rings, as the planet emerges this fall in the
predawn sky.

blacks out a large swath of rings on the right.

What would Saturn's rings look like if the ring plane pointed directly at the Sun?

That situation occurred earlier this month when
<a href="ap080922.html">equinox</a> occurred on Saturn.  

Since the Earth is nearly in the same direction as the Sun from Saturn, the rings
<a href="ap950801.html">appeared to disappear</a> from Earth.

From the robotic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini–Huygens">Cassini spacecraft</a>
orbiting Saturn, however, the unusually illuminated ring plane could be viewed from on high.

<a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5771/Saturn_Equinox_Raw_Preview_4"
>Pictured above</a>, Saturn's rings, darker than ever seen before,
were captured just a few hours before
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturntourdates/"
>equinox</a> on 2009 August 10.

The reason for the unusual brightness of an inner ring is currently unknown, but possibly related to
<a href="ap050525.html">particle sizes</a>
there being larger than the 10 meter average thickness of the rest of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn">Saturn's rings</a>.

Short light streaks in the frame are artificial image artifacts and
have nothing to do with

Planetary scientists will be studying
<a href="http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002060/">ring images taken near
equinox</a> to help better understand the dynamics and particle size distribution of the Solar System's most extensive ring system.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

What has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus?  

Vast sections of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29">this strange world</a>
are dark as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</a>, while others are as bright as ice.  

The composition of the dark material is unknown, but
<a href="http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html"
>infrared</a>
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html"
>spectra</a> indicate that it possibly contains some dark form of
<a href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html">carbon</a>.


Iapetus also has an unusual
<a href="ap050201.html">equatorial ridge</a> that makes it appear like a
<a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=99">walnut</a>.  

To help better understand this seemingly painted moon,
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/index.html">NASA</a>
directed the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_spacecraft">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a>
orbiting Saturn to swoop
<a href="ap070919.html">within 2,000 kilometers</a> in 2007.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08384">Pictured above</a>,
from about 75,000 kilometers out, Cassini's trajectory allowed unprecedented imaging of the hemisphere of Iapetus that is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">always trailing</a>.  

A huge impact crater seen in the south spans a tremendous 450 kilometers
and appears superposed on an
<a href="ap060530.html">older crater</a> of similar size.

The <a href="ap070914.html">dark material</a>
is seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of
<a href="ap060103.html">Iapetus</a>, darkening craters and highlands alike.  

<a href="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/"
>Close inspection</a> indicates that the dark coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick.

A <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005DPS....37.3908S"
>leading hypothesis</a> is that the dark material is mostly
dirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty ice
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)"
>sublimates</a>.

An initial coating of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYvITG_TDfE">dark material</a> may have been effectively painted on by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from other moons.

This and other images from Cassini's
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baaGOqIJaFM"
>Iapetus flyby</a> are being studied for even greater clues.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Do underground oceans vent through the tiger stripes on Saturn's moon Enceladus?  

Long features dubbed tiger stripes are known to be
<a href="ap071013.html">spewing ice</a> from the moon's icy interior into space,
creating a cloud of fine ice particles over the moon's South Pole
and creating Saturn's mysterious <a href=
"ap070327.html">E-ring</a>.  

Evidence for this has come from the
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/presentposition/"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06254">Pictured above</a>,
a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown from a close flyby.  

The unusual surface features dubbed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger"
>tiger</a> stripes are visible in false-color blue.  

Why
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?enceladus"
>Enceladus</a> is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon
<a href="ap090517.html">Mimas</a>,
approximately the same size, appears
<a href="http://www.davidpbrown.co.uk/jokes/monty-python-parrot.html"
>quite dead</a>.

Most recently, an
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20090624/"
>analysis of dust</a> captured by
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BzXC4qfV44"
>Cassini found evidence</a> for sodium as expected in a deep salty ocean.  

Conversely however, recent Earth-based observations of ice ejected by Enceladus into Saturn's E-Ring showed no
<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/06/24/does-enceladus-harbor-a-liquid-ocean-reasonable-minds-disagree/">evidence</a> of the expected 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium">sodium</a>.  

Such research is particularly interesting since such an ocean would be a candidate to

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What causes the mysterious spokes in Saturn's rings?

Visible in the
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11452">above image</a>
as light ghostlike impressions, spokes were 
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/astronomy-topics/saturn.html"
>first discovered</a> in the mid-1970s and first photographed by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager spacecraft</a>
that buzzed by Saturn in the early 1980s.  

Their existence was unexpected.

Oddly, the <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>spokes</a> are more commonly observed when Saturn's rings are more nearly edge on to the Sun, and so were conspicuously
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005DPS....37.6111M"
>absent</a> from initial images sent back by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini–Huygens"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn.  

Analyses of archived
<a href="ap020831.html">Voyager</a> images have led to the
conclusions that the transient spokes, which may form and dissipate over a few hours, are composed of electrically charged sheets of small dust-sized particles.

Hypotheses for spoke creation include small meteors impacting the rings and
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006GeoRL..3321202J"
>electron beams</a> from Saturnian atmospheric
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.P43B1292H">lightning
spraying</a> the rings.

spoke sightings like that

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What's causing those strange dark streaks in the rings of Saturn?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(moon)">Prometheus</a>.  

Specifically, an orbital dance involving
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/prometheus.html"
>Saturn's moon Prometheus</a> keeps creating unusual light and dark streamers in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings#F_Ring">F-Ring</a> of Saturn.

Now <a href="ap041217.html">Prometheus</a> orbits Saturn just inside the thin
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/rings.html"
>F-ring</a>, but ventures into its inner edge about every 15 hours.

Prometheus' gravity then
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JdzjXlvBYE">pulls the closest
ring particles</a> toward the 100-km moon.  

The result is not only a stream of bright
<a href="ap050525.html">ring particles</a> but also a
<a href="ap081208.html">dark ribbon</a> where ring particles used to be.  

Since
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKhYSv3FZP4">Prometheus</a>
orbits faster than the ring particles, the icy moon pulls out a new streamer every pass.  
Sometimes, several streamers or
<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prometheus_tugging_on_F_Ring_PIA09909.jpg">kinks</a> are visible at once.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What's causing unusual jagged shadows on Saturn's rings?

No one is yet sure.  

As Saturn nears 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox">equinox</a>, 
its rings increasingly show only their 
<a href="ap051219.html">thin edge</a> to the Earth and Sun.  

As a result, Saturn's moons now commonly 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGNxKnLmOH4">ca</a>s<a 
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGNxKnLmOH4">t</a> long  
<a href="ap031127.html">shadows</a> onto the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn">rings</a>.

An example of this is the elongated vertical shadow of 
<a href="ap050308.html">Mimas</a> seen on the above right.

The series of 
<a href="http://planetary.org/blog/article/00001909/">shorter, jagged shadows</a> that run diagonally, however, are more unusual.

Now Saturn's rings have been known to be made of particles for 
<a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">hundreds of years</a>, 
but these particles have so far escaped direct imaging.  

It is therefore particularly exciting that a 
<a href="http://planetary.org/blog/article/00001909/">preliminary hypothesis</a> holds that these 
<a href="http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?showtopic=5951">jagged shadows</a> are 
<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/04/12/cassinis-indirect-image-of-boulders-and-moonlets-in-saturns-rings/">silhouettes</a> of 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=2984"
>transient groups of ring particles</a> 
temporarily held close by their own gravity.  

Future work will surely continue, as the robotic 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn that took the <a href=
"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/rawimagedetails/index.cfm?imageID=188106"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Every 14 to 15 years, Saturn's rings
<a href="ap090304.html">are tilted</a>
edge-on to our line of sight.

As the bright, beautiful rings seem to grow narrower
it becomes increasingly
difficult to see them, even with large telescopes.

But it does provide the opportunity to watch multiple
transits of Saturn's moons.

During a transit, a sunlit moon and its shadow
glide across the cloudy face of the gas giant.

Recorded on February 24,
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2009/12/index.html">this
Hubble image</a> is part of a
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/

showing the transit of four of Saturn's moons.

From left to right are <a href="ap050224.html">Enceladus</a>
and <a href="ap051205.html">shadow</a>,
<a href="ap051021.html">Dione</a>
and <a href="ap050329.html">shadow</a>, and
Saturn's largest moon <a href="ap041028.html">Titan</a>.

Small moon <a href="ap050308.html">Mimas</a> is just
touching Saturn's disk near the
ring plane at the far right.

The shadows of Titan and Mimas have both moved off
the right side of the disk.

<a href="ap090111.html">Saturn itself</a>
has an equatorial diameter of about 120,000 kilometers.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Very good telescopic
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/Education/saturnobservation/
viewing2009/">views of Saturn</a> can be expected in the coming days
as the ringed planet
<a href="ap090227.html">nears opposition</a> on March 8th, its closest
approach to Earth in 2009.

Of course, opposition means opposite the Sun in planet
<a href="http://www.earthsky.org/article/
give-me-five-minutes-ill-give-you-saturn">Earth's sky</a> -
an arrangement that occurs almost yearly for Saturn.

But while Saturn itself grows larger in telescopic images,
Saturn's rings seem to be vanishing as
<a href="ap070406.html">their tilt</a> to our line-of-sight
decreases.

In fact, the rings will be nearly invisible, edge-on from
our perspective, by September 4.

Recorded on February 28, this sharp image was made with the 1 meter
telescope at
<a href="http://bagn.obs-mip.fr/webcam/">Pic Du Midi</a>, a
<a href="ap080125.html">mountain top</a>
observatory in the French Pyrenees.

The rings are seen to be tilted nearly edge-on, but
remarkable details are visible in the gas giant's cloud bands.

The icy moon <a href="ap080624.html">Tethys</a> appears just beyond
the rings at the lower left.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/
35992534.html">Tracking through</a>
the constellation Leo on February 23rd,
bright planet Saturn and
<a href="ap090225.html">Comet Lulin</a>
were both near
<a href="ap080718.html">opposition</a> -- opposite the Sun in
planet Earth's sky.

They also passed within only 2 degrees of each other
creating a dramatic
<a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/
gallery_lulin_page15.htm">celestial photo-op</a>.

Comet Lulin was near its closest approach to planet Earth at
the time, at a distance of some 61 million kilometers, but
<a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2007+N3&orb=1">was
orbiting</a> in the opposite direction.

As a result it swept remarkably rapidly
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXhBfsgsZpU">across the
background</a> of stars.

<a href="http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOW_DIG/096.HTM">This telephoto
image</a> captures both bright Saturn and greenish
Lulin in the same field in a scene not too different from
binocular views.

Don't recognize
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/
19feb_quadrupletransit.htm">ringed Saturn</a>?

The rings are presently tilted nearly edge-on to our
view and the brighter planet is overexposed to record details
of the fainter comet.

At the upper right, Saturn is marked by multiple diffraction
spikes created by the aperture blades in the telephoto lens.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

In the shadow of Saturn, unexpected wonders appear.

The 
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEM9D2HHZTD_0.html"
>robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> recently drifted in giant planet's 
<a href="ap040926.html">shadow</a> for about 12 hours and looked
back toward the 
<a href="ap010408.html">eclipsed Sun</a>.  

Cassini saw a view unlike any other.  

First, the 
<a href="ap060912.html">night side of Saturn</a> 
is seen to be partly lit by light reflected from its own 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/rings.html"
>majestic ring system</a>. 

Next, the rings themselves appear dark when 
<a href="ap060921.html">silhouetted</a> against Saturn, 
but quite bright when viewed away from Saturn,
<a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/forward_scattering.html"
>slightly scattering</a> sunlight, in this 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08329"

Saturn's rings light up so much that 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08322"
>new rings</a> were discovered, although they are hard to see in the
image.  

Seen in spectacular detail, however, is Saturn's 
<a href="ap070327.html">E ring</a>, the ring created by the newly discovered 
<a href="ap051205.html">ice-fountains</a> of the moon 
<a href="ap050906.html">Enceladus</a> and the outermost ring visible above.  

Far in the 
<a href="ap060927.html">distance</a>, 
at the left, just above the bright main rings, is the almost ignorable

What's causing this unusual aurora over Saturn?

No one is sure.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)"
>aurora</a> unlike any other seen previously in

>our Solar System</a>.

The strange aurora are shown in blue in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11396"
>above image</a>, while the underlying clouds are shown in red.  

The previously recorded, also-strange 
<a href="ap070403.html">hexagon cloud patterns</a> 
are visible in red below the aurora.

These Saturnian aurora can cover the entire pole, while auroras around Earth and Jupiter are typically confined by magnetic fields to rings surrounding the magnetic poles.

More normal auroral rings had been 
<a href="ap050219.html">previously imaged</a> around Saturn.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What clouds lurk beneath Saturn's unusual South Pole?

To help find out, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?Saturn">Saturn</a> imaged the nether region of the gigantic ringed orb in 
<a href="http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html">infrared</a> light.

There thick clouds appear dark as they mask much of the infrared light emitted from warmer regions below, while relatively thin clouds appear much lighter.  

<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20050905a.cfm">Bands 
of clouds</a> circle Saturn at several latitudes, while dark ovals indicate many dark swirling storm systems.  

Surprisingly, a haze of upper level clouds visible towards Saturn's equator disappears near the pole, including over Saturn's 
<a href="ap061113.html">strange polar vortex</a>.

Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in 2004, and recorded the

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Why would Saturn show such strange colors?

The robotic 
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEM9D2HHZTD_0.html"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Saturn has 
<a href="http://cassini-huygens.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/FlightOps/telemetry.shtml"
>beamed back</a> images showing that the northern hemisphere our 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6yHKE9dg0g"
>Solar System</a>'s most spectacularly 
<a href="ap040712.html">ringed planet</a> 
has changed noticeably since Cassini arrived in 2004, 
now sporting unusual and unexpected colors.

No one is sure why.  

Although the cause for many of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Atmosphere"
>Saturn's colors</a> is unknown, 
the recent <i>change</i> in colors is thought to be related to the 
<a href="ap030405.html">changing seasons</a>.


<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10487">Pictured above</a>, 
the unusual colors are visible just north of the dark 
<a href="ap060503.html">ring shadows</a>.

The <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/18mar_saturn.htm"
>razor-thin plane</a> of ring particles is visible 
nearly edge-on across the bottom of the image.

The cloudy moon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)"
>Titan</a> looms large just above the rings, 
while close observation will reveal 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10487 ">three other</a> 
moons.   

Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, sending back data and images that have not only led to a deeper understanding of the Jovian world's atmosphere, moons, and rings, but also raised new <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-08-27-saturn-mysteries_N.htm">mysteries</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What created this unusual partial ring around Saturn?  

Discovered last year, the arc was captured in 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11101">clear detail</a> 
only two months ago by the Saturn-orbiting 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini spacecraft</a>. 

Since the arc occupies the same orbit as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthe_(moon)">small moon Anthe</a>, 
a leading hypothesis holds that the arc was created by, and is replenished by, 
<a href="ap071114.html">meteor impacts</a> on Anthe.  

Similar arcs have been previously discovered, including an 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11102">arc</a> associated with the small Saturnian moon 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methone_(moon)">Methone</a>, one 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08327">arc related to Saturn's G ring</a>, and several arcs orbiting 
<a href="ap060618.html">Neptune</a>.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11101">Pictured above</a>, 
Anthe, only two kilometers across, is seen as the bright point near the top of the Anthe arc.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Anthe_Ring_Arc">Anthe arc</a> 
was imaged by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm">robotic space probe</a> 
as it swooped to within 1.5 million kilometers of the small moon.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Soft hues, partially lit orbs, a thin trace of the ring, and slight shadows highlight this understated view of the majestic surroundings of the giant planet Saturn.  

Looking nearly back toward the Sun, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens">robot Cassini 
spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn captured 
<a href="ap060618.html">crescent phases</a> of 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a> and its 
<a href="ap060530.html">moon Rhea</a> in color a few years ago.

As striking as the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07806"
>above image</a> is, it is but a single frame from a recently released 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA07806.mov"
>60-frame silent movie</a> where Rhea can be seen gliding in front of its parent world.   

Since Cassini was nearly in the plane of 
<a href="http://pds-rings.seti.org/saturn/">Saturn's rings</a>, the normally impressive rings are visible here only as a 
<a href="ap051219.html">thin line</a> across the image center.

Although Cassini has now concluded its 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm">primary mission</a>, 
its past successes and opportunistic location have prompted 
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> to start a two-year 
<a href="http://ciclops.org/view_event/87/Cassinis_Next_Chapter_Begins">Equinox Mission</a>, further exploring not only Saturn's enigmatic moons 
<a href="ap060215.html">Titan</a> and

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What created the Great Rift on Saturn's moon Tethys?

No one is sure.  

More formally named 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Chasma">Ithaca Chasma</a>, 
the long canyon running across the right of the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09918">above image</a> 
extends about 2,000 kilometers long and spreads as much as 100 kilometers wide.

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09918">above image</a> 
was captured by the Saturn-orbiting robotic 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm">Cassini spacecraft</a> 
as it zoomed by the icy moon last month.  

<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/1749.pdf">Hypotheses for the 
formation</a> of Ithaca Chasma include cracking of 
<a href="ap051012.html">Tethy's outer crust</a> 
as the moon cooled long ago, and that somehow the rift is related to the huge 
<a href="ap070909.html">Great Basin</a>

Cassini has now been orbiting 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a> 
for about four years and is scheduled to continue to probe and

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What do Saturn's rings look like from the other side?  

From Earth, we usually see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn"
>Saturn's rings</a> from the same side 
of the ring plane that the Sun illuminates them.

Geometrically, in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09906"
>above picture</a> taken in April by the 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/cassini_tour.html"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>, 
the Sun is behind the camera but on the 
<I>other side</I> of the ring plane. 

This vantage point, specifically 17 degrees above the ring plane, gives a 
<a href="ap050211.html">breathtaking view</a>s of the most 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>splendid ring system</a> in the Solar System.

Strangely, the rings have similarities to a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)"
>photographic negative</a> of a front view.

The ring brightness as recorded from different angles 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001DPS....33.2901P"
>indicates</a> ring thickness and particle density of ring particles.

Elsewhere, <a href="ap050722.html">ring shadows</a> 
can be seen on the sunlit face of Saturn, shown sporting numerous 
<a href="ap050225.html">cloud structures</a> in nearly true color.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
How do large storms evolve on Saturn?

On Earth, a 
<a href="ap980928.html">hurricane</a> can persist for weeks, while the 
<a href="ap990718.html">Great Red Spot</a> on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a> has been in existence for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_red_spot#Observation_history">over 150</a> years.

On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>, 
a storm system has now set a new endurance record, 
now being discernable for greater than three months.  

<a href="ap000717.html">Electrical signals</a> 
were detected from the storm in late November of 2007, while the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08411">above image</a> 
was taken in early March 2008. 

The storm has roughly the width of planet Earth. 

Planetary scientists hypothesize that the storm runs deep into Saturn's cloud tops.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08411">above image</a> 
is shown in exaggerated colors combining violet and green light with light normally 
<a href="http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html">too red</a> 
for humans to see.

Visible on the upper right are shadows of 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/rings.html">Saturn's 
expansive ring system</a>.  

Careful inspection will reveal Saturn's small moon 
<a href="ap061107.html">Janus</a> just below a ring shadow.  

Understanding weather on other planets helps 
atmospheric scientists better understand our Earth's weather.  

Observers of our 
<a href="http://jrgraphix.net/research/flash_sol.php">Solar System</a>'s 
huge ringed world will be tracking the storm to see how it evolves and how 
long it will ultimately last.

<b> Explanation: </b>

Known for its bright <a href="ap071217.html">ring</a>
system and many <a href="ap071010.html">moons</a>, gas giant
Saturn looks strange and unfamiliar in this false-color

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
How old are Saturn's rings?  

No one is quite sure. 

One possibility is that the rings formed relatively recently in our
Solar System's history, perhaps only about 100 million years ago when
a moon-sized object 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">broke up</a> near Saturn.  

Evidence for a young ring age includes a basic 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133..656V">stability
analysis for rings</a>, 
and the fact that the rings are so bright and
relatively unaffected by numerous small dark 
<a href="ap011118.html">meteor</a> impacts.  

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-149">New
evidence</a>, however, raises the possibility that some of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings">Saturn's rings</a> 
may be billions of years old and so almost as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Parker">old</a> as Saturn itself.   

Inspection of images by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft
indicates that some of 
<a href="ap040723.html">Saturn's ring</a> particles temporarily
bunch and collide, effectively recycling 
<a href="ap071024.html">ring</a> particles by bringing
fresh bright ices to the surface.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09788">Seen here</a>, 
Saturn's rings were imaged in their true colors by the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">robotic

Icy bright <a href="ap070909.html">Tethys</a>, 
a moon of Saturn likely brightened by a sandblasting 
<a href="ap071013.html">rain of ice</a> from sister moon

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Saturn never shows a crescent phase -- from Earth.  

But when viewed from beyond, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">majestic giant planet</a> 
can show an unfamiliar diminutive sliver.

This <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/
PIA08388">image of crescent Saturn</a> in natural color was
taken by the robotic 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/index.cfm">Cassini
spacecraft</a> in May.

The image captures 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn">Saturn's
majestic rings</a> from the side of the ring plane opposite
the Sun -- the <a href="ap050622.html">unilluminated side</a> -- another
vista not visible from Earth.

Pictured are many of Saturn's photogenic wonders, including the 
<a href="ap060503.html">subtle colors</a> of 
<a href="ap041102.html">cloud bands</a>, the complex 
shadows of the rings on the planet, 
the <a href="ap040721.html">shadow of the planet</a>
on the rings, and the moons 
<a href="ap050308.html">Mimas</a> (2 o'clock), 
<a href="ap061107.html">Janus</a> (4 o'clock), and 
<a href="ap051123.html">Pandora</a> (8 o'clock).

As Saturn moves towards 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox">equinox</a> in 2009, 
the ring shadows are becoming smaller and moving toward the equator.   

During equinox, the rings will be 
<a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">nearly invisible</a> 
from Earth and project only an extremely 
thin shadow <a href="ap981018.html">line</a> onto the planet.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus?  

Vast sections of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29">this strange world</a> 
are dark as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</a>, while others are as bright as ice.  

The composition of the dark material is unknown, but 
<a href="http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/infrared.html"
>infrared</a> 
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html"
>spectra</a> indicate that it possibly contains some dark form of

Iapetus also has an unusual 
<a href="ap050201.html">equatorial ridge</a> that makes it appear like a 
<a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=99">walnut</a>.  

To help better understand this mysterious moon, 
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/index.html">NASA</a> 
directed the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_spacecraft">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> 
orbiting Saturn to swoop 
<a href="ap070919.html">within 2,000 kilometers</a> just last month.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08384">Pictured above</a>, 
from about 75,000 kilometers out, Cassini's trajectory allowed unprecedented imaging of the hemisphere of Iapetus that is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">always trailing</a>.  

A huge impact crater seen in the south spans a tremendous 450 kilometers 
and appears superposed on an 
<a href="ap060530.html">older crater</a> of similar size.

The <a href="ap070914.html">dark material</a> 
is seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of 
<a href="ap060103.html">Iapetus</a>, darkening craters and highlands alike.  

<a href="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
If seen in the right light, Saturn glows like a neon sign.  

Although Saturn has comparatively little of the 
<a href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/10.html">element neon</a>, a 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09212">composite image</a> 
false-colored in three bands of 
<a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/discovery.html"
>infrared light</a> highlights features of the giant ringed planet like a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_sign">glowing sign</a>. 

At the most blue band of the infrared light featured, false-colored blue in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09212">above image</a>, 
Saturn itself appears dark but 
<a href="ap040712.html">Saturn's thin rings</a> brightly reflect light from our Sun.   

Conversely, 
<a href="http://pds-rings.seti.org/saturn/vgr2_iss/PIA02274.html">Saturn's B ring</a> 
is so thick that little reflected light makes it through, creating a dark band between 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn's_rings">Saturn's A and C rings</a>.  

At the most red band of the infrared, false-colored red above, 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a> emits a surprisingly detailed 
<a href="ap061012.html">thermal glow</a>, 
indicating planet-wide bands, huge hurricane-like storms, and a 
<a href="ap070403.html">strange hexagon-shaped cloud system</a> around the 
<a href="ap040919.html">North Pole</a>.  

In the middle infrared band, false-colored green, 
the sunlit side of Saturn's atmosphere reflects brightly.   

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09212">above image</a> 
was obtained in late February by the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">robotic

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

What is this vast dark region on Titan?  

Quite possible a sea of liquid 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a>.

The region was imaged earlier this month when the robotic 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_spacecraft">Cassini spacecraft</a> swooped past Saturn's cloudy moon and illuminated part of it with radar.  

The dark region in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09211">above image</a> 
reflected little radar, an effect expected were the 
<a href="ap070207.html">dark surface</a> relatively flat, as expected for a liquid.   

Other indications that the vast dark area is liquid include the 
<a href="ap050124.html">coastline-like topology</a> of the brighter regions, 
which appear to include <a href="ap971108.html">islands, inlets</a>, 
and tributary channels.

The uninterrupted smoothness of much of the dark sea may indicate that the sea runs deep, 
with <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09211">speculation</a> 
holding a depth estimate of tens of meters.

A <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08930">hydrocarbon sea</a> on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28moon%29">Titan</a> 
holds particular interest for 
<a href="http://exobiology.nasa.gov/ssx/exobiology.html">exobiologists</a> 
as it might be a place where life could develop.  

In 2005 the Huygens probe landed on Titan and returned the 
<a href="ap050117.html">first surface image</a>s.  

Cassini will continue to explore Titan, as 13 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/saturn-tour.cfm">more flybys</a> are planned.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

On May 22nd, just days after sharing the western evening sky
<a href="ap070523.html">with Venus</a>, the Moon moved
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm">on to Saturn</a> -
actually passing in
front of the ringed planet when viewed in skies over
Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.

Because the Moon and bright planets wander through the sky
near the <a href="ap050503.html">ecliptic plane</a>, such
<a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/planets/
planets.htm">occultation events</a> are
not uncommon, but they are
<a href="ap030724.html">dramatic</a>, especially in
telescopic views.

For example, in this sharp image Saturn is captured
<a href="http://www.tamanti.it/Solar%20Sys/SaturnOccultation.htm">emerging
from</a> behind the Moon, giving the illusion
that it lies just beyond the Moon's bright edge.

Of course, the Moon is a mere 400 thousand kilometers away,
compared to Saturn's distance of 1.4
<a href="http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp">billion</a> kilometers.

<a href="http://www.kopfgeist.com/besonderes.htm">Taken with</a>
a digital camera and 20 inch diameter telescope
at the <a href="http://www.sternwarte-weikersheim.de/about/
about_set.html">Weikersheim Observatory</a> in southern Germany,
the picture is a single exposure adjusted to reduce the
difference in brightness between Saturn and the
cratered lunar surface.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Swooping below Saturn, the Cassini spacecraft spied several strange wonders.  

Visible in the distance are some of the many 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html">complex rings</a> 
that orbit the 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html">Solar System</a>'s 
second largest planet.  

In the foreground looms the gigantic world itself, covered with white dots that are clouds high in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>'s thick atmosphere.   

<a href="ap051010.html">Saturn's atmosphere</a> is so thick that only clouds are visible.  

At the very 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08332">South Pole of Saturn</a> 
lies a <a href="ap061113.html">huge vortex</a> that is a 
<a href="ap040915.html">hurricane</a>-like storm showing no sign of dissipating.   

The robotic

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Using an image recorded just last month as a base,
this composite illustration tracks the
motion of <a href="ap070406.html">bright Saturn</a> as it wanders
through planet
<a href="http://soc.jpl.nasa.gov/viewing.cfm">Earth's night sky</a>.

Starting at the upper right, Saturn's position is shown about
every two weeks beginning in August 2005 and projected
through September 2008.

Over the three year period, Saturn actually appears to reverse
its general eastward (leftward) drift,
tracing out three flattened curves.

The periodic backwards or
<a href="ap060422.html">retrograde motion</a> with
respect to the background stars is a
reflection of the motion of the Earth itself.

<a href="http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/
retrograd.html">Retrograde motion</a> can be seen each time Earth overtakes
and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the
Earth moving more rapidly through its own
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/retrograde/
copernican.html">closer-in</a> orbit. 

The <a href="ap060128.html">Beehive</a> star cluster in Cancer
lies near the track at the upper right.

Stars along the "backward question mark" at the head
<a href="http://stardate.org/nightsky/constellations/leo.html">of Leo</a>
are in the left half of the frame.

Saturn's position
<a href="http://skytonight.com/observing/home/April_podcast.html">this
month</a> is near the right hand limit 
of the middle curve.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="ap040117.html">Saturn and</a> its magnificent
<a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">ring system</a>
can offer even casual astronomers the most memorable of telescopic sights.

Wandering between Leo and Cancer
<a href="http://skytonight.com/observing/home/April_podcast.html">this
month</a>, a bright
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn is</a>
well placed for
<a href="http://soc.jpl.nasa.gov/viewing.cfm">viewing in
evening skies</a>.

But from our earthbound perspective,
the tilt of Saturn's rings does
<a href="ap030405.html">change with time</a>.

In <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/13/
video/a/">1995 and 1996</a>
the broad rings were edge-on and nearly invisible, gradually opening
to a spectacular
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/13/
video/c/">maximum tilt</a> of about 27 degrees by 2003.

This frame from a
<a href="http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/
saturn_04_07.html">series of Saturn</a> images beginning a year later,
in 2004, and ending just last month shows the steady decrease
in apparent tilt as the rings head toward another
edge-on presentation in 2009.

Saturn's south pole is toward the bottom.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Why would clouds form a hexagon on Saturn?

Nobody is yet sure.   

Originally discovered during the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager</a> flybys of 
Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen anything like it anywhere else in the 
<a href="http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/">Solar System</a>. 

If Saturn's South Pole wasn't strange enough with its 
<a href="ap061113.html">rotating vortex</a>, 
Saturn's North Pole might now be considered even stranger.  

The bizarre cloud pattern is 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09188">shown above</a> 
in a recent infrared image taken by the 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?saturn">Saturn</a>-orbiting 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/">Cassini spacecraft</a>.

The images show the stability of the 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hexagon.html">hexagon</a> 
even 20 years after Voyager.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09187">Movies</a> 
of Saturn's North Pole show the cloud structure maintaining its 
hexagonal structure while rotating.  

Unlike individual clouds appearing like a 
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=3350 ">hexagon on Earth</a>, 
the Saturn 
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070327.html"
>cloud pattern</a> appears to have six well defined sides of nearly equal length.

Four 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0610/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg"
>Earth</a>s could fit inside the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">hexagon</a>.

Although full 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990Sci...247.1061A">explanations</a> are not yet available, planetary scientists are sure to continue to study this

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
The active moon Enceladus appears to be making Saturn's E ring.

An <a href="http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=2231">amazing picture</a> 
showing the moon at work was taken late last year by the Saturn-orbiting 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/">Cassini spacecraft</a> and is 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08321">shown above</a>.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28moon%29">Enceladus</a> 
is the dark spot inside the bright flare, right near the center of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#E_Ring">Saturn's E ring</a>.  

Streams of ice and water vapor can be seen 
<a href="ap051205.html">pouring off Enceladus</a> into the E ring.  

The above bright image of the normally faint 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006Sci...311.1416S"
>E-ring</a> was made possible by aligning Cassini so that 
<a href="ap061016.html">Saturn blocked</a> the Sun.   

From that perspective, small ring particles reflect incoming 
<a href="ap011030.html">sunlight</a> more efficiently.

Cassini has now been orbiting Saturn for almost three years, and is 
<a href="http://planetary.org/explore/topics/cassini_huygens/tour.html"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
This image of Saturn could not have been taken from Earth. 

No <a href="ap000701.html">Earth</a> based picture could possibly view the night side of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a> and the corresponding 
<a href="ap061016.html">shadow</a> cast across Saturn's rings. 

Since Earth is much closer to the Sun than Saturn, 
only the day side of the planet is visible from the Earth. 

In fact, <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08362"
>this image mosaic</a> was taken in January by the robotic 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/">Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn.   

The beautiful rings of Saturn are seen in full expanse, while 
<a href="ap051010.html">cloud details</a> are visible near the night-day 
<a href="ap050611.html">terminator</a> divide.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What would the rings of Saturn look like if you passed right <i>through</i> the ring plane?

To find out, NASA aimed cameras from the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/">Cassini spacecraft</a> right at 
<a href="http://planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/rings.html"
>Saturn's rings</a> as the 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/cassini_huygens/tour.html" 
>robotic explorer</a> passed from the sunlit side of the rings to the 
<a href="ap050622.html">shadowed side</a>.   

Resulting images from a vantage point outside the rings and most moons,
but inside the orbit of <a href="ap060215.html">Titan</a>,
have been gathered together in the 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000842/">above time-lapse movie</a>.  

The <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000842/">dramatic movie</a> 
demonstrates that ring particle density and 
reflectivity makes some parts of the shadowed side nearly the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)">photographic negative</a> 
of the sunlit side, but nearly empty regions remain continually dark.  

Visible also are Saturn-orbiting moons 
<a href="ap060310.html">Enceladus</a>, 
<a href="ap050308.html">Mimas</a>, 
<a href="ap061107.html">Janus</a>,

<a href="ap041217.html">Prometheus</a>, and 
<a href="ap051123.html">Pandora</a>.  

The extreme 
<a href="ap051219.html">thinness of Saturn's rings</a> 
can be appreciated from frames taken near the crossing time.

What lies at the bottom of

Nobody knows.  To help find out, the

That image, <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07740"
>shown above</a> in false color, shows a remarkable world strewn with 
strange craters and a generally odd surface.   

The slight differences in color likely show differences in surface composition.   

At the bottom of most craters lies some type of unknown dark material.  

Inspection of the <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-release-details.cfm?newsID=605"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What causes the mysterious spokes in Saturn's rings? 

Visible on the left of the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08316">above image</a> 
as ghostlike impressions, spokes were first discovered by the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager spacecraft</a> 
that buzzed by Saturn in the early 1980s.  

Their existence was unexpected, and no genesis hypothesis has ever become accepted.  

Oddly, the <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>spokes</a> were conspicuously 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005DPS....37.6111M"
>absent</a> from initial images sent back by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> 
now orbiting Saturn.  

Analyses of archived 
<a href="ap020831.html">Voyager</a> images have led to the 
conclusions that the transient spokes, which may form and dissipate over a few hours, are composed of electrically charged sheets of small dust-sized particles.

Some recent images from Cassini like that 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08316">shown above</a> 
have now finally shown the enigmatic spokes superposed on 
<a href="ap050525.html">Saturn's B ring</a>.  


Hypotheses for spoke creation include small meteors impacting the rings and 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006GeoRL..3321202J"
>electron beams</a> from Saturnian atmospheric 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061120/full/061120-14.html">lightning 
spraying</a> the rings.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What's happening at the south pole of Saturn?  

To find out, scientists sent the robot 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens">Cassini probe</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://eightplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>
 directly over the lower spin axis of the ringed giant.  

Cassini found there a spectacular massive swirling 
storm system with a well developed eye-wall, similar to a 
<a href="ap040915.html">hurricane here on Earth</a>.  

One image of the storm is 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08332">shown above</a>, while several frames from the overpass have been made into a 
<a href="http://ciclops.org/media/ir/2006/2313_6310_4.mpg">movie</a> 
that shows the 
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8112690528797127090"
>huge vortex rotating</a>.

The storm is slightly larger than the entire Earth and carries winds that reach 
550 kilometers per hour, twice the velocity of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale">Category 5</a> hurricane.

This pole vortex on Saturn might have been raging for billions of years 
and is not expected to 
<a href="ap040919.html">drift off</a> the pole.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Janus is one of the stranger moons of Saturn.  

First, <a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/janus.html">Janus</a> 
travels in an unusual orbit around Saturn where it periodically trades places with its sister moon 
<a href="ap050429.html">Epimetheus</a>, 
which typically orbits about 50 kilometers away.   

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_%28moon%29">Janus</a>, 
although slightly larger than 
<a href="ap050824.html">Epimetheus</a>, is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato">potato</a>-shaped and 
has a largest diameter of about 190 kilometers.  

Next, Janus is covered with large craters but strangely appears to lack small craters.  

One possible reason for this is a fine dust that might cover the small moon, 
a surface also hypothesized for 
<a href="ap051123.html">Pandora</a> and 
<a href="ap060222.html">Telesto</a>.  


Pictured <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08296">above</a>, 
Janus was captured in front of the 
<a href="ap051010.html">cloud tops</a> of

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
In the shadow of Saturn, unexpected wonders appear.

The 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm">robotic Cassini 
spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> recently drifted in giant planet's 
<a href="ap040926.html">shadow</a> for about 12 hours and looked back toward the 
<a href="ap010408.html">eclipsed Sun</a>.  

Cassini saw a view unlike any other.  

First, the 
<a href="ap060912.html">night side of Saturn</a> 
is seen to be partly lit by light reflected from its own 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/images_saturn_rings.html">majestic ring system</a>. 

Next, the rings themselves appear dark when 
<a href="ap060921.html">silhouetted<a/> against Saturn, 
but quite bright when viewed away from Saturn and 
<a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/forward_scattering.html"
>slightly scattering</a> sunlight, in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08329"
>above exaggerated color image</a>.

Saturn's rings light up so much that 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08322"
>new rings</a> were discovered, although they are hard to see in the above image.  

Visible in spectacular detail, however, is Saturn's 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/rings.html"
>E ring</a>, the ring created by the newly discovered 
<a href="ap051205.html">ice-fountains</a> of the moon 
<a href="ap050906.html">Enceladus</a>, and the outermost ring visible above.  

Far in the 
<a href="ap060927.html">distance</a>, 
visible on the image left just above the bright main rings, is the almost ignorable 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">pale blue dot</a> of Earth.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Known for its bright <a href="ap040117.html">ring</a>
system and many <a href="ap051021.html">moons</a>, gas giant
Saturn looks strange and unfamiliar in this false-color
view from the Cassini spacecraft.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08732">In fact,
in this</a> Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer
(<a href="http://wwwvims.lpl.arizona.edu/">VIMS</a>)
mosaic the famous rings
are almost invisible, seen edge-on cutting across
picture center.

The most striking contrast in the image is
along the terminator or boundary between night and day.

To the right (day side) blue-green hues
are visible sunlight reflected from Saturn's cloud tops.

But on the left (night side) in the absence of sunlight,
the <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/

<b> Explanation: </b>
What's that pale blue dot in this image taken from Saturn?  

<a href="ap010204.html">Earth</a>.  

The <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm">robotic Cassini spacecraft</a> 
looked back toward its old home world earlier this month as it orbited 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(planet)">Saturn</a>.  

Using Saturn itself to block the 
<a href="ap030530.html">bright Sun</a>, 
Cassini imaged a faint dot on the right of the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08324">above photograph</a>.  

That dot is expanded on the image inset, where a slight elongation in the direction of 
<a href="ap030526.html">Earth's Moon</a> is <a href="ap980904.html">visible</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
This is what Saturn looks like at night.  

In contrast to the 
<a href="ap040822.html">human-made lights</a> that cause the 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg"
>nighttime side of Earth</a> to glow faintly, 
Saturn's faint nighttime glow is primarily caused by sunlight reflecting off of its own 
<a href="ap050525.html">majestic rings</a>.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08252">above image</a> 
of Saturn at night was captured in July by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm">Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
Saturn.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08252">above image</a> 
was taken when the Sun was far in front of the spacecraft. 

From this vantage point, the northern hemisphere of nighttime Saturn, visible on the left, appears eerily dark.  

Sunlit rings are visible ahead, but are abruptly cut off by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>'s shadow.

In Saturn's southern hemisphere, visible on the right, the dim reflected glow from the sunlit rings is most apparent.

Imprinted on this diffuse glow, though, are thin black stripes not discernable to any 
<a href="ap971227.html">Earth telescope</a> -- the silhouetted 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings">C ring</a> of Saturn.

Cassini has been orbiting Saturn since 2004 and its 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens">mission</a> 
is scheduled to continue until 2008.

<A HREF=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060711.html><img alt="Thumbnail image of picture found for this day." src=/apod/calendar/S_060711.jpg></A><A HREF=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060711.html> APOD: 2006 July 11 - Crescent Rhea Occults Crescent Saturn 
</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Soft hues, partially lit orbs, a thin trace of the ring, and slight shadows highlight this understated view of the majestic surroundings of the giant planet Saturn.  

Looking nearly back toward the Sun, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini-Huygens">robot Cassini 
spacecraft</a> now orbiting Saturn captured 
<a href="ap060618.html">crescent phases</a> of 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a> and its 
<a href="ap060530.html">moon Rhea</a> in color a few months ago.

As striking as the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07806"
>above image</a> is, it is but a single frame from a recently released 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA07806.mov"
>60-frame silent movie</a> where Rhea can be seen gliding in front of its parent world.   

Since Cassini was nearly in the plane of 
<a href="http://pds-rings.seti.org/saturn/">Saturn's rings</a>, the normally impressive rings are visible here only as a 
<a href="ap051219.html">thin line</a> across the image center.

Cassini has now passed the official half-way mark of its mission around Saturn, but is well situated to complete 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-release-details.cfm?newsID=670"
>another two years</a> investigating this complex and surprising system.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
The moons of Saturn never stop.  
 
A space traveler orbiting the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">ringed giant planet</a> 
would witness a continuing 
<a href="ap030227.html">silent dance</a> where Saturn's 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/moons.html" 
>multiple moons</a> pass near each other in numerous combinations.  
 
Like a miniature 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html" >Solar System</a>, 
the innermost moons 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtonkepler.html" 
>orbit</a> Saturn the fastest.  
 
The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07804" 
>above movie</a> was centered on Saturn's moon 
<a href="ap060530.html">Rhea</a>, so that the moons 
<a href="ap050308.html">Mimas</a> and 
<a href="ap060310.html">Enceladus</a> appear to glide by.
 
At 1,500 kilometers across, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_%28moon%29" >Rhea</a> 
is over three times larger than the comparably sized 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_%28moon%29" >Mimas</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28moon%29" >Enceladus</a>.
 
The Sun illuminates the scene from the lower right, 
giving all of the moons the same 
<a href="ap051113.html">crescent phase</a>.
 
The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07804" 
>above time lapse movie</a> was created by the Saturn-orbiting robotic

<b> Explanation: </b>
Saturn's ragged moon Rhea has one of the oldest surfaces known. 
 
Estimated as changing little in the past billion years, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_%28moon%29" >Rhea</a> shows 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater" >craters</a> 
so old they no longer appear round – their 
edges have become compromised by more recent cratering.  
 
Like <a href="ap051113.html">Earth's Moon</a>, 
Rhea's rotation is locked on Saturn, and the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08173" 
>above image</a> shows part of 
<a href="ap051213.html">Rhea's surface</a> that always faces Saturn.
 
Rhea's leading surface is more highly cratered than its trailing surface.  
 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?rhea" 
>Rhea</a> is composed mostly of water-ice but is thought to have a 
small rocky core.
 
The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08173"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Why is Saturn partly blue? 

The 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08166">above picture</a> 
of Saturn approximates what a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human">human</a> 
would see if hovering close to the giant ringed world.    

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08166">above picture</a> 
was taken in mid-March by the robot 
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Cassini-Huygens/SEM9D2HHZTD_0.html"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>.  

Here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings"
>Saturn's majestic rings</a> appear directly only as a thin vertical line.  

The rings show their complex structure in the dark shadows they create on the image left.   

Saturn's fountain moon <a href="ap060310.html">Enceladus</a>, 
only about 500 kilometers across, is seen as the bump in the plane of the rings.  

The northern hemisphere of 
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/17feb_bluesaturn.htm"
>Saturn can appear partly blue</a> for the same reason that 
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html"
>Earth's skies can appear blue</a> -- molecules in the cloudless portions 
of both planet's atmospheres are better at  scattering blue light than red.  

When looking deep into 
<a href="ap051010.html">Saturn's clouds</a>, however, the natural 
gold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant.   

It is not known why <i>southern</i> Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- 
one hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there.    

It is also

Some images of Saturn appear surreal.  

Earlier this year, the robot 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm">spacecraft Cassini</a> 
now orbiting Saturn took this 
<a href="ap030616.html">surreal image</a> of the gas giant

Enceladus, recently found to 
<a href="ap051205.html">emit jets</a> of ice from 
<a href="ap060310.html">possible underground seas</a>, 
appears white as its surface is covered with relatively clean water-ice.

The storm (top) was actually spotted last month by amateur

When the storm was on the same side of Saturn as the Cassini spacecraft,

were detected, suggesting lightning discharges
connected with the storm were responsible for the radio emission.

note that this storm appears along the planet's southern

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_orbit"
>retrograde orbit</a>, unusually dark surface,

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

If you can
<a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/images2006/27jan06/
skymap_north.gif">find Saturn</a> in tonight's sky, then
you can also find <a
href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m044.html">M44</a>,
popularly known as the <a href="ap020925.html">Beehive</a>
star cluster.

In fact, with a pair of binoculars most casual skygazers should
find it fairly easy to zero in on this
<a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance/
article_110_1.asp">celestial scene</a>.

Saturn is at
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/
image-details.cfm?imageID=1972">opposition</a> - opposite the Sun
in Earth's sky - so, the bright planet rises in the east at sunset
and is visible throughout the night.

Near the
<a href="http://www.scienceu.com/observatory/articles/retro/
retro.html">stationary part</a> of its wandering path through
the heavens, Saturn will obligingly linger for a while
in the vicinity of M44 in the relatively faint
<a href="http://www.coldwater.k12.mi.us/lms/planetarium/myth/
cancer.html">constellation Cancer</a>.

Seen here in a photograph from January 25, Saturn (lower right)
is strongly overexposed with the stars of M44 swarming above
and to the left. 

The picture approximately corresponds to
<a href="http://www.visualdeepsky.org/netastrocatalog/
msg00123.html">the view</a> when looking
through a typical pair of binoculars.

<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planets/
saturnpage.html">Saturn is</a>
about 64 light-minutes from our fair planet
while M44, one of the closest star clusters, is around
600 light-years away.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Presently <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/
image-details.cfm?imageID=1972">at opposition</a>
in planet Earth's sky,
<a href="http://soc.jpl.nasa.gov/viewing.cfm">Saturn is well placed</a>
for telescopic
<a href="http://soc.jpl.nasa.gov/history.cfm">observations</a>.

On Wednesday two amateur astronomers took full advantage of
the situation from Melun, near Paris, France.

With a 12 inch diameter telescope and
<a href="ap010714.html">web cam</a> they recorded
this sharp image of the
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">ringed gas giant</a>
and made an
<a href="http://jldauvergne.club.fr/storm.htm">exciting discovery</a> --
a new storm on Saturn.

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/
PIA06507">storm</a> appears as the white spot visible here in
Saturn's southern hemisphere (south is toward the top in
the picture).

In particular, the storm seems to correspond with an outburst
of radio noise detected by the Cassini spacecraft.

The phenomenon is likely similar to the
<a href="ap050225.html">Dragon Storm</a> recorded by
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/
inst-cassini-rpws-details.cfm">Cassini's instruments</a>
early last year.

That storm is thought to be analogous to a terrestrial
<a href="http://thunder.msfc.nasa.gov/primer/">thunderstorm</a>,
with radio noise produced in high-voltage
<a href="ap040818.html">lightning</a> discharges.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Why are vast sections of Iapetus as dark as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal">coal</a>?    

No one knows for sure.

Iapetus, the 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/iapetus.html">third largest moon</a> of 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>, 
was inspected again as the Saturn-orbiting robot 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> swooped past the 
enigmatic world again late last year. 

The dark material covers most of the surface visible in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07660">above image</a>, 
while the small portion near the top that appears almost white is of a
color and reflectance more typical of Saturn's other moons.

The unknown material covers about half of the 1,500 kilometer
wide moon.

The material is 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003DPS....35.0404B">so dark</a> 
that it reflects less than five percent of incident sunlight, 
yet overlays craters indicating that it was spread after the 
craters were formed.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29">Iapetus</a> 
has other unexplained features.

The bright part of 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/iapetus.html">Iapetus</a> 
is covered with unexplained long thin streaks.  

The orbit of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28mythology%29"
>Iapetus</a> is also unusual, being tilted to the plane of Saturn's 
orbit by an unusually high fifteen degrees.

A <a href="ap050201.html">strange ridge</a> 
about 13 kilometers high crosses much of Iapetus near the 
equator and is visible
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07660">near
the bottom</a>.  

Oddly, this ridge is almost exactly parallel with Iapetus' equator.

The exact shape of Iapetus remains undetermined, 
but images indicate that it is quite strange -- 
something like a
<a href="http://www.whfoods.com/
genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=99">walnut</a>.   

Research into the formation and history of 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Arriving <a href="ap030817.html">at Saturn</a> in July of 2004, the
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm">Cassini spacecraft</a>
has now spent a year and a half exploring the
magnificent rings and moons of the distant gas giant.

The year 2005 began with Cassini's
<a href="ap050117.html">Huygens probe landing</a>
on Saturn's large moon Titan.

Cassini's continuing series of close flybys
<a href="ap050610.html">also revealed</a>
details and discoveries
across the surface of the smog shrouded moon.

In fact, with a <a href="ap051021.html">ringside</a>
seat throughout 2005, Cassini's cameras
have made spectacular pictures of Titan along with
<a href="http://ciclops.org/view_event.php?id=48&flash=1">Saturn's
other moons</a> and rings
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/index.cfm">almost
common place</a>.

But often, Saturn itself provided the most dramatic backdrop.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07771">In this
view</a>, Saturn's moon Dione lies in front of edge-on
rings and the gas giant's cloud tops draped with broad
ring shadows.

<a href="ap041201.html">Dione is</a> 1,118 kilometers across
and lies about 300,000 kilometers from the ring's edge.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
How thin are the rings of Saturn?  

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997Icar..129..555B"
>Brightness measurements</a> from different angles have shown 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/rings.html">Saturn's rings</a> 
to be about one kilometer thick, making them many times thinner, 
in relative proportion, than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_blade"
>razor blade</a>.  

This thinness <a href="ap051021.html">sometimes appears</a> in 
<a href="ap950801.html">dramatic fashion</a> 
during an image taken nearly along the ring plane.  

The <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a> 
has now captured another shot that dramatically highlights the ring's thinness.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07654"

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">infrared</a> 
<a href="http://acept.la.asu.edu/PiN/rdg/polarize/polarize.shtml"
>polarized</a> light.   

If alone in space, the unlit part of Saturn would be much darker.  

Reflection of light off of moons like

<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/12feb_rings.htm"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What does Saturn's small moon Pandora look like?  

To help find out, the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> 
now orbiting Saturn passed about 50,000 kilometers from the unusual moon in 
early September.  

The highest resolution image of Pandora ever taken was then captured and is 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07632"
>shown above</a> in representative colors.  

Features as small as 300 meters can be discerned on 80-kilometer wide 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/pandora.html#pandora">Pandora</a>.  

Craters on Pandora appear to be covered over by some sort of material, 
providing a more smooth appearance than sponge-like 
<a href="ap051003.html">Hyperion</a>, another small moon of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>.  

Curious <a href="ap041120.html">grooves</a> and 
<a href="ap020602.html">ridges</a> 
also appear to cross the surface of the small moon.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora">Pandora</a> 
is partly interesting because, along with its companion moon 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, 
it helps shepherd the particles of

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
These two moons change places.  

<a href="ap050429.html">Epimetheus</a> and 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/janus.html">Janus</a>, 
two small moons of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>, 
actually switch positions as they orbit their home planet.   

The orbital radii of the moons are strangely separated by less than the 
radii of the moons themselves: about 50 kilometers.  

One moon orbits Saturn well ahead of the other, at first.  

As the two moons gravitationally attract, they approach each other and, every few years, actually 
<a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/epimetheus_and_janus.html"
>pass and trade orbits</a>.   

This <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997APS..OFS...G01B"
>strange dance</a> creates speculation that 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/epimetheus.html"
>Epimetheus</a> and Janus were once joined and later split from each other.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07615">Pictured above</a>, 
the two moons were photographed rounding their orbits just outside of

<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/hyperion.html">Hyperion</a> 
to be an even stranger place than thought before.  

Previously, it was known that the length of a day on 
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Hyperion"
>Hyperion</a> is unpredictable.  

The moon's highly

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What do Saturn's rings look like from the other side?  

From Earth, we usually see Saturn's rings from the same side 
of the ring plane that the Sun illuminates them.

Geometrically, in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07520"
>above picture</a> taken in April by the 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/cassini_tour.html"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>, 
the Sun is behind the camera but on the 
<I>other side</I> of the ring plane. 

Such a vantage point gives a 
<a href="ap050211.html">breathtaking view</a>s of the most 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>splendid ring system</a> in the Solar System.

Strangely, the rings have similarities to a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)"
>photographic negative</a> of a front view.

For example, the dark band in the middle is actually the 
<a href="ap040723.html">normally bright B-ring</a>.

The ring brightness as recorded from different angles 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001DPS....33.2901P"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Eating surface ice from Enceladus might be healthier 
than eating ice from Saturn's rings -- it certainly appears cleaner.  

From their apparent <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1994Icar..109..241D"
>densities</a> and reflectance properties, both the 
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html"
>rings of Saturn</a> and its shiniest moon, 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/enceladus.html">Enceladus</a>, 
are thought to be composed predominantly of 
<a href="http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/FAQ.htm">water ice</a>.  

For reasons that are not yet understood, however, many of 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>Saturn's ring particles</a> have become partly coated with some 
sort of relatively dark dust, while the surface of 
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Enceladus"
>Enceladus</a> appears comparatively bright and clean.  

The contrast between the two can be seen in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06653"
>above image</a> taken last month by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/index.cfm"

<a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>.  

Bright <a href="ap050224.html">Enceladus</a> shines 
in the background in contrast to the darker foreground rings.  

The reason why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28mythology%29"
>Enceladus</a> is so bright is currently 
unknown but might involve bringing fresh water to its surface with

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What causes small waves in Saturn's rings?  

Observations of rings bordering the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeler_gap">Keeler gap</a> in 
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html">Saturn's rings</a> showed unusual waves.  

Such waves were first noticed last July and are 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06239"
>shown above</a> in clear detail.

The picture is a digitally foreshortened 
image mosaic taken earlier this month by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>.  

The rings, made of many 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>small particles</a>, were somehow not orbiting Saturn in their usual manner.

Close inspection of the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06238"
>image shows</a> the reason - a small moon is orbiting in the Keeler gap.  

The previously unknown moon is estimated 
to span about seven kilometers and appears to have the same 
<a href="ap040723.html">brightness</a> as nearby ring particles.   

The <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtongrav.html"
>gravity</a> of the small moon likely perturbs the orbits of 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005DDA....36.0301B"
>ring particles</a> that come near it, 
causing them to shimmy back and forth after the moon passes.  

Since inner particles orbit more quickly than outer particles, 
only the leading particles of the inner rings and the 
trailing particles of the outer rings show the wave effect.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
If this is Saturn, where are the rings?  

When Saturn's "appendages" 
<a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">disappeared</a> 
in 1612, <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html"
>Galileo</a> did not understand why.   

Later that century, it became understood that 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>'s unusual protrusions were rings and that when the 
<a href="ap950801.html">Earth crosses the ring plane</a>, 
the edge-on rings will appear to disappear.  

This is because Saturn's rings are confined to a <a href=
"http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_kids/AskKids/saturnrings.shtml"
>plane many times thinner</a>, in proportion, than a 
<a href="http://www.quikshave.com/timeline.htm">razor blade</a>.  

In modern times, the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn now also crosses 
<a href="ap040117.html">Saturn's ring</a> plane.  

A series of plane crossing images from late February 
was dug out of the vast 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/index.cfm"
>online Cassini raw image</a> archive by interested Spanish amateur 
Fernando Garcia Navarro.  

<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/raw-images-list.cfm?StartRow=225&cacheQ=1&browseLatest=0&storedQ=972627"
>Pictured above</a>, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, 
is the striking result.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/view.php?id=870">Dubbed
the "Dragon Storm"</a>, convoluted, swirling cloud features
are tinted orange in this false-color, near-infrared image of
Saturn's southern hemisphere.

In one of a series of
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/
press-release-details.cfm?newsID=547">discoveries announced</a> by
Cassini researchers, the Dragon Storm was found to be
responsible for <a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/
view.php?id=897">mysterious bursts</a> of radio static
monitored by
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/
inst-cassini-rpws-details.cfm">Cassini instruments</a>
during the last year as the spacecraft
orbited the ringed planet.

The storm is now thought to be a giant
<a href="ap030817.html">Saturnian</a>
thunderstorm,
like storms <a href="ap040818.html">on Earth</a>,
with radio noise produced in high-voltage
<a href="http://thunder.msfc.nasa.gov/primer/">lightning</a>
discharges.

The Cassini observations are also consistent with the Dragon Storm
being a long-lived storm, deep within the gas giant's
<a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/saturn/atmosphere/
S_clouds_decks.html&edu=high">atmosphere</a>,
that periodically flares-up to produce large,
visible <a href="ap041102.html">storm regions</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Are Saturn's auroras like Earth's?  

To help answer this question, the 
<a href="ap010806.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> monitored Saturn's South Pole 
simultaneously as 
<a href="ap040301.html">Cassini closed in</a> 
on the gas giant in January 2004.  

Hubble snapped images in 
<a href="http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/uv.html"
>ultraviolet light</a>, while Cassini recorded 
<a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio.htm">radio emissions</a> 
and monitored the 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/sun/wind.html">solar wind</a>.  

Like on Earth, <a href="ap050219.html">Saturn's auroras</a> 
make total or partial <a href="ap970402.html">rings</a> around 
<a href="ap040919.html">magnetic pole</a>s.  

Unlike on Earth, however, 
<a href=
"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/06/text/"
>Saturn's auroras</a> persist for days, as opposed to only minutes on 
<a href="ap020101.html">Earth</a>.  

Although surely created by 
<a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Ielect.html"
>charged particles</a> entering the atmosphere, 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004AGUFM.P53B..01C"
>Saturn's auroras</a> also appear to be more closely modulated by the 
<a href="ap000318.html">solar wind</a> than either Earth's or

The <a href=

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Serene blue hues
<a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/view.php?id=753">highlight
this view</a> of Saturn's northern
hemisphere from the Cassini spacecraft.

The image has been adjusted to approximate the natural
<a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/view.php?id=676">blue color</a>
of visible sunlight scattered by the
gas giant's upper atmosphere.

Saturn's famous rings cast the dark
<a href="ap041202.html">shadows stretching</a> across
the frame with
<a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/mimas.html">infamous</a>
cratered moon
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/mimas.html">Mimas</a>
lurking at the lower left.

Orbiting beyond the
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/rings.html">main
inner rings</a>, Mimas itself is 400 kilometers across and
lies nearly 200,000 kilometers, over 3
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/

from the center of the planet.

Still, Mimas orbits within Saturn's faint and tenuous outer

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

This strange,
<a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/news/science/
saturn/">false-color image</a>
of otherwise familiar planet
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/
saturnfact.html">Saturn</a> shows temperature changes based on
<a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/">thermal infrared</a>
emission in the gas giant's
<a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/saturn/
lower_atmosphere.html&edu=high">atmosphere</a> and rings.

Recorded from the Keck I telescope on
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/">Mauna Kea</a>,
the sharp, ground-based picture of Saturn's
southern hemisphere is a mosaic of 35 images.

Based on the <a href="ap040626.html">effects</a>
of sunlight during the southern
<a href="ap030405.html">summer season</a>, general warming trends were
anticipated.

But a surprising result of the infrared image data
is the a clear indication of an abruptly warmer polar
cap and bright hot spot at Saturn's south pole.

The warm south pole and hot spot may be unique in the
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/index.cfm">solar system</a>
and a further exploration of the region
is planned using
<a href="http://cirs.gsfc.nasa.gov/">instruments</a> on the Cassini
spacecraft.

So how hot is Saturn's hot spot?

The upper tropospheric temperature is a sweltering 91
<a href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/staff/blynds/
tmp.html">Kelvin</a>
(-296 degrees Fahrenheit) at the pole.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus? 

A strange ridge crosses the moon near the equator, 
visible near the bottom of the above image, making 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/iapetus.html">Iapetus</a> 
appear similar to the 
<a href="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/syllabi/319/1peach.html"
>pit of a peach</a>.  

Half of <a href="ap951015.html">Iapetus</a> 
is so dark that it can nearly disappear when viewed from Earth.  

Recent observations show that the degree of 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004Icar..170..125V"
>darkness of the terrain</a> is strangely uniform, 
like a dark coating was somehow recently applied 
to an ancient and highly cratered surface.  

The other half of <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/iapetus.htm"
>Iapetus</a> is relatively bright but oddly covered with long and 
thin streaks of dark.  

A 400-kilometer wide impact basin is visible near the image center, 
delineated by deep <a href="ap970218.html">scarps</a> 
that drop sharply to the crater floor.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06166"

Methane rain, evaporating lakes, flowing rivers,

dark channel near the top of the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07236"

Both the riverbed and lakebed were 
<a href="http://www.floridatoday.com/blogs/011405huygens/">thought</a> 
to be dry at the time the image was taken but contained a flowing liquid - likely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane">methane</a> - in the recent past.

<b> Explanation: </b>

As a present to APOD readers, digital imager Mattias Malmer
offers a very high resolution view of big beautiful Saturn.

A labor of love, his full mosaic, composite image is contained
in a large 5 megabyte jpeg file
(<a href="image/0412/saturn_malmerCassini_pre10.jpg">preview</a> here,
<a href="image/0412/saturn_malmerCassini_5m.jpg">download</a> here) and
spans the gorgeous gas giant from ring tip to ring tip.

It was pieced together from 102 frames
(N00020905 to N00021033) recorded by the
<a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/iss/iss.php">Cassini

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

In Greek Mythology,
<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/p/
prometheus.html">Prometheus</a> was known for stealing fire from
the gods.

Ironically, in a story for more modern times Prometheus
may also become known for stealing, but this time for stealing
<a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_kids/
AskKids/saturnrings_ice.shtml">icy</a> particles from Saturn's rings.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/

from the Cassini spacecraft shows the
100 kilometer-long
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/

ring_structure_big_jpg_image.html&edu=high">orbiting</a>
near the inner edge of <a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/
rings.html">Saturn's F ring</a>.

The dramatic view clearly resolves the potato-shaped moon and
multiple strands of the <a href="ap041202.html">narrow</a>
F ring.

It also reveals a faint strand of material connecting
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/
profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Prometheus">Prometheus</a> with the rings.

One possibility is that the tiny moon's gravity is indeed
drawing off particles from the rings and is
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/
catalog/PIA05387">influencing</a> the
formation of the gaps and kinks seen in the ring structure.

What causes the bright streaks on Dione?  

Recent and likely future images of this unusual moon by the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm"
>robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting

might help us find out.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06528"
>above image</a> was taken at the end of October from a distance of about one million kilometers.

The bright streaks run across some of Dione's many craters, indicating that the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1984Icar...59..205M"
>process</a> that created them occurred later than the

<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/dione.htm">Dione</a> 
is made of mostly water ice but its relatively high density 
indicates that it contains much rock inside. 

<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/Bios/cassini.html"

<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/tethys.htm">Tethys</a> 
is composed almost completely of water ice and shows a large impact crater that nearly circles the moon.  Because this crater did not disrupt the moon, 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/tethys.html">Tethys</a> 
is hypothesized to be at least partly liquid in its past.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What causes storms on Saturn?  

To help find out, scientists commanded the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/index.cfm">robot Cassini spacecraft</a> now orbiting 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a> 
to inspect a circulating band of clouds 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06507"
>nicknamed "Storm Alley."</a>  

This westwardly moving cloud ring has been unusually 
active since the beginning of 2004, spawning 
<a href="ap951018.html">white swirling storms</a> and 
dark storms ringed by sprawling white clouds all 
cascading around the gas giant.  

The rogue band, as well as other parts of 
<a href="ap041018.html">south Saturn</a>, were 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06507">imaged in 
stunning detail</a> in a very specific band of 
<a href="http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/ems/infrared.html"
>infrared light</a> that passes through Saturn's 
<a href="ap000429.html">upper haze</a> relatively unblurred.  

The result was then digitally sharpened, showing more cloud detail 
but creating fake image artifacts such as a surrounding ring.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Are Saturn's rings transparent?  

The <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/index.cfm"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> that recently entered orbit around 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a> 
has confirmed that some of 
<a href="ap040723.html">Saturn's rings</a> 
are more transparent than others.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06114"
>Pictured above</a>, Saturn's main 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/rings.html"
>A, B, and C rings</a> can be seen, top to bottom, 
superposed against the gas giant planet. 

Although the B-ring across the top is opaque, Saturn's <a href=
"http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/saturn/atmosphere/S_clouds_overview.html"
>cloud tops</a> can be clearly seen through the lower C-ring.  

The translucent nature of the 
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=1567"
>C-ring</a> likely indicates that it is less densely populated with ring particles than the B-ring.  

The <a href=

This picture of Saturn could not have been taken from Earth. 

No Earth based picture could possibly view the 
<a href="ap950705.html">night side of Saturn</a> 
and the corresponding shadow cast across Saturn's rings. 

Since <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> is much closer to the 
<a href="sun.html">Sun</a> than 
<a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>, 
only the day side of the planet is visible from the Earth.  

Rather, <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05417"
>this picture</a> was taken by the robot 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> that began orbiting Saturn earlier this month.  

The dark western limb of

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What causes the patterns in Saturn's rings?  

The <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> just entering orbit around 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn</a>

<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/latest/index.cfm"
>spectacular images</a> of 
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html"
>Saturn's immense ring system</a> in unprecedented 
<a href="ap040702.html">detail</a>.  

The physical cause for many of 
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec04/cassini_7-01.html"
>newly resolved ring structures</a> 
is not always understood.   

The cause for the beautifully geometric type of ring structure 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06093"
>shown above</a> in 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/saturn/rings.html">Saturn's A ring</a>, however, is hypothesized to be a spiral 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999DPS....31.4406S"

A small moon systematically perturbing the orbits of 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/rings.html"
>ring particles</a> orbiting at slightly different distances 
causes such a

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1983Icar...53..185S"
>bending wave</a>, a vertical wave in ring particles also 
caused by the gravity of a nearby moon.  

This close-up spans about 220 kilometers.

Cassini is <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/index.cfm"

Was Saturn's moon Phoebe once a comet?  

Images from the robotic

<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a> 
may have originated in the outer 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html">Solar System</a>.  

Phoebe's 
<a href="ap040614.html">irregular surface</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_orbit"
>retrograde orbit</a>, unusually dark surface, 
assortment of large and small craters, and low average density 
appear consistent with the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-releases-04/20040614-pr-a.cfm"
>hypothesis</a> that Phoebe was once part of the 
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb.html"

captured by Saturn.  

Visible in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06064"

What caused the unusual light and dark layers on 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>'s moon 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>?  

The layers were discovered just Friday during the 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.cfm"
>Cassini spacecraft</a> flyby of the small moon.  

Such layering is particularly evident on the 
<a href="ap010428.html">crater</a> just above the image center, 
where alternating light and dark material makes this crater appear 
particularly structured.  

Cassini scientists 
<a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/view.php?id=196"
>speculate</a> that such layering 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/approach.cfm"
>might result</a> from an 
<a href="ap990711.html">impact</a> where a dark surface layer becomes intertwined with a lighter subsurface ice layer.  

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06067"

The robot spacecraft was 
<a href="ap971016.html">launched</a> in 1997 and

<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/
21apr_planets2.htm">wandering through</a> Earth's night sky,
magnificent
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">planet Saturn</a>
lies nearly 1.5 billion kilometers
<a href="http://www.thursdaysclassroom.com/19jul01/poem1.html">from
the Sun</a>.

But after an interplanetary voyage of <a href="ap971016.html">seven
years</a> the planet's
stunning rings nearly fill the field of the Cassini
spacecraft's narrow angle camera
<a href="http://ciclops.lpl.arizona.edu/PR/2004D29/PR2004D29A.html">in
this image</a> recorded on March 27.

Tip to tip, the
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html">ring
system</a> spans about 270,000 kilometers.

Named for
<a href="http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/HST/Huygens/
huygens.htm">discoverers</a>, the large, easily visible gap in the
rings is known as the Cassini division, while the narrower
outer gap is the Encke division.

Illuminated from below and to the right, the rings cast a shadow on
Saturn's upper hemisphere, interrupted where sunlight streams through
the Cassini division and creates a light blue streak.

At the left,
<a href="ap020907.html">Saturn also</a> casts a stark shadow across
the planet girdling rings.

On July 1, the Cassini

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Above, the ringed planet
<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2004/saturn/">Saturn
shines in x-rays</a>.

Otherwise <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/
xrays.html">beyond the range</a> of human vision, the eerie
x-ray view was created by overlaying a computer
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/tools/viewer2_sat.html">generated
outline</a> of the gas giant's disk and ring system on a false-color
picture of smoothed,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/?0401270">reconstructed
x-ray data</a>
from the orbiting Chandra Observatory.

The data represent the first clear detection
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/
saturnfact.html">of Saturn's</a> disk
at x-ray energies and held some surprises for
researchers.

For starters, the x-rays seem concentrated near the planet's
equator rather than the poles, in marked contrast to
observations <a href="ap020301.html">of Jupiter</a>, the only
other gas giant seen at such high energies.

And while Saturn's high energy emission is found to be consistent
with the reflection of x-rays
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/
know_l2/sun.html">from the Sun</a>, the intensity of the
reflected x-rays was also found to be unusually strong.

Outside the planet's disk, only a faint suggestion of x-rays from
Saturn's <a href="ap040117.html">magnificent</a>
ring system
<a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/planets/

PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA03162">Uniquely bright</a>
compared to the rings of the
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/">other gas giants</a>,
Saturn's ring system is around 250,000 kilometers wide but in places only
a few tens of <i>meters</i> thick.

Modern astronomers believe
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/faq.html">the rings
are</a> perhaps only a hundred million years
<a href="http://spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/osskids/animate/saturn.html">young</a>.

Since Galileo, astronomers have subjected
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html">the

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

These
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/23/image/a">three
views of Saturn</a> were
recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope on March 7th of this
year, as the southern hemisphere of the solar system's most gorgeous
planet reached its maximum 27 degree <a href="ap030405.html">tilt
toward Earth</a>.

The images used
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/23/
fastfacts">to construct</a>
the false-color pictures were made
through a combination of
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/behind_the_pictures/
meaning_of_color/hubble.shtml">filters covering</a> the
electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet (top), to visible (middle)
and infrared (bottom) wavelengths highlighting different
<a href="http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v35n4/dps2003/
22.htm">features</a> in the Saturnian atmospheric bands and rings.

Well known for its bright <a href="ap020215.html">ring</a>
system and large,
mysterious moon <a href="ap020905.html">Titan</a>,
gas giant
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/
saturnfact.html">Saturn is</a>
also a planet with a dynamic atmosphere and high-speed winds.

In fact, in the 1980s,
<a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/saturn.html">Voyager
spacecraft measured</a> equatorial
winds of over 1,000 miles per hour.

Giant <a href="ap030916.html">storm systems</a>,
comparable in size to planet Earth itself, have been seen
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/1994/53/

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
What could you see approaching Saturn aboard an
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/index.cfm"
>interplanetary cruise</a> ship?

Your view would likely resemble
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/28/b.html">this
subtly shaded image</a> of the gorgeous ringed gas giant.

Processed by the <a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/">Hubble
Heritage</a> project, the picture intentionally
avoids overemphasizing color contrasts and presents a
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/
public/Oct22/saturn/saturntable.html#caption">natural looking Saturn</a>
with cloud bands, <a href="ap951018.html">storms</a>, nearly
<a href="ap981018.html">edge-on rings</a>, and the small round shadow
of the moon Enceladus near the center of the planet's disk.

Of course, seats were not available on the only ship currently 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/operations/present-position.cfm"
>en route</a>, the
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/index.shtml">Cassini

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/rhea.html">Rhea</a> 
is the second largest moon of 
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/choices/saturn1.htm">Saturn</a>, 
behind <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/titan.html">Titan</a>, 
and the largest without an atmosphere. 

It is composed mostly of water ice, but has a small rocky core. 

<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/rhea.htm">Rhea</a>'s 
rotation and orbit are locked together (just like 
<a href="ap010218.html">Earth's Moon</a>) 
so that one side always faces Saturn. 

A consequence of this is that one side always leads the other. 

Rhea's leading surface is much more heavily cratered than its trailing
surface. 

The <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sat/rhea2.htm"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Since <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html">Saturn's</a>
axis is tilted as it orbits the
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html">Sun</a>, 
Saturn has <a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/
Sseason.htm">seasons</a>, like those of planet Earth ...
but Saturn's seasons last for over seven years.

<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2001/15/table.html#caption">So
what season</a> is it on Saturn now?

Orbiting the equator, the tilt of the
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html">rings
of Saturn</a> provides quite a graphic seasonal display.

In fact, this month, Saturn's rings will reach their most "open"
angle after appearing
<a href="ap950801.html">nearly edge</a> on in the mid-1990s.

The <a href="ap020215.html">ringed planet</a>
is also well placed in
<a href="http://stardate.org/nightsky/almanac/">evening skies</a>
providing a grand view as summer comes to Saturn's southern
hemisphere and winter to the north.

The Hubble Space Telescope took the above
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2001/15/">sequence
of images</a> about a year apart, starting on the
left in 1996 and ending on the right in 2000.  

Although they look solid, Saturn's Rings are likely
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/
nph-bib_query?bibcode=1984Sci...223..396Z">less than 50 meters
thick</a> and
consist of individually
orbiting bits of ice and rock ranging in size from grains
of sand to barn-sized boulders.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

This delightfully detailed
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/1998/18/">false-color
image of Saturn</a> was taken in January 1998 by the
orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.

The picture is a combination of three images from Hubble's
NICMOS instrument and shows the lovely ringed planet in reflected
<a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/discovery.html">infrared
sunlight</a>.

Different colors indicated varying heights and compositions of cloud
layers generally thought to consist of ammonia ice crystals.

<a href="ap020215.html">The eye-catching rings</a> cast a shadow
<a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html">on
Saturn's</a> upper hemisphere.

The bright stripe seen within the left portion of the shadow
is infrared sunlight streaming through the large
<a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/saturnrings.html">gap
in the rings</a> known
as the <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/
Cassini.html">Cassini</a> Division.

Two of
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturniansatfact.html"
>Saturn's many moons</a> have also put in an appearance,
<a href="ap970531.html">Tethys</a> just
beyond the planet's disk at the upper right, and Dione at the lower left.

Presently, Saturn shines brightly in evening skies as a
pale yellow "star" near the constellation
<a href="ap021225.html">Orion</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/
saturn.html">Wandering</a>
through the constellation Taurus,
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/13dec_saturn.htm">Saturn
made</a> its
closest approach to planet Earth last month, tilting its lovely rings
toward appreciative skygazers while rising high in midnight skies.

On January 4th and 5th, Saturn also crossed in front of the
<a href="http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/crab.htm">high and far-off</a>
Crab Nebula (M1), a cosmic cloud of
debris from a stellar explosion and first on the list of
astronomer <a href="ap960626.html">Charles Messier's</a>
celestial sights.

But <a href="http://www.marcush.net/astronomy/m1.html">Saturn
and the Crab</a> made poor playmates,
as light from the bright planet overwhelmed the
the diffuse nebula, all but hiding the Crab
<a href="http://www.surveyor.in-berlin.de/himmel/
indexe.html#saturn">during the transit</a>.

Taken on January 2nd,
a few days before their closest encounter,
this composite digital image illustrates the problem.

The <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m001.html">subtle
nebula</a> is just visible at the right,
while on the left, light from a drastically over-exposed Saturn
overflows its pixels.

Composited into the image is a correctly exposed picture of
<a href="ap021104.html">ringed Saturn</a>
with the Saturnian moons labeled.

The well-exposed Saturn image was also taken
on January 2nd, but captured with an exposure
lasting only a fraction of a second, in contrast with
the tens of seconds of exposure time required to
reveal the Crab.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Tethys is one of the larger and closer moons of Saturn. 

It was visited by both 
<a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager spacecraft</a> - 
Voyager 1 in November 1980 and by 
<a href="ap960629.html">Voyager</a> 2 in August 1981. 

<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/tethys.html">Tethys</a> 
is now known to be composed almost completely of water ice. 

<a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/tethys.htm"
>Tethys</a> shows a large 
<a href="ap990711.html">impact crater</a> 
that nearly circles the planet. 

That the impact that caused this crater did not 
disrupt the moon is taken as evidence that 
<a href="http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/features/planets/saturn/tethys.html"
>Tethys</a> was not completely frozen in its past.  

Two smaller moons, 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/tethys.html#telesto"

<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/tethys.html#calypso"
>Calypso</a>, orbit

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Born on today's date in 1564,
<a href="ap011014.html">Galileo</a> used a telescope to
explore the Solar System.

In 1610, he became the
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/saturn.html">first
to be amazed</a> by Saturn's rings.

After nearly 400 years,
<a href="http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/
12feb_rings.htm">Saturn's magnificent rings</a> still offer
one of the most stunning astronomical sights.

<a href="http://photojournal-a.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/
PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA03162">Uniquely bright</a>
compared to the rings of the
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/">other gas giants</a>,
Saturn's ring system is around 250,000 kilometers wide but in places only
a few tens of <i>meters</i> thick.

Modern astronomers believe
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/faq.html">the rings
are</a> perhaps only a hundred million years
<a href="http://spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/osskids/animate/saturn.html">young</a>.

But accumulating dust and dynamically interacting with
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/nineplanets/
saturn.html">Saturn's</a>
moons, the rings may eventually darken and sag toward
the gas giant, losing their lustre over the next
few hundred million years.

Since Galileo, astronomers have subjected
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html">the
entrancing rings</a> to intense scrutiny to unlock their secrets.

Still mesmerized, some will take advantage of next week's
(February 20th) favorable lunar occultation of Saturn
<a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/planets2002/
0221ring.htm">to search for evidence</a>
of ring material outside the
<a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20010625.html">well known</a> boundaries
of the ring system.

The presence of such a "lost" ring of Saturn was first
hinted at in reports
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">dating back</a>
to the early 20th century.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Last November,
while <a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/pam.orman/
JoeGallery.html">skygazing</a> toward the constellation
<a href="http://hou.lbl.gov/~vhoette/Explorations/StarHop/">Taurus</a>,
astrophotographer Joe Orman arranged this time exposure to
include the lovely Hyades and Pleiades star clusters in the
field of his telephoto lens.

A distance of 400 <a href="http://school.discovery.com/
schooladventures/universe/itsawesome/lightyears/">light-years</a>
for the close-knit
<a href="ap010506.html">Pleiades</a>
and 150 light-years for the
<a href="http://www.aspsky.org/mercury/mercury/9803/hyades.html">V-shaped</a>
<a href="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Hipparcos/hyades.html">Hyades</a>
puts these clusters in the general galactic
<a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/
250lys.html">neighborhood</a> of the Sun.

Punctuating the Hyades' appearance, bright yellow
<a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/aldebaran.html">Aldebaran</a>,
60 light-years away, is not actually a member of the cluster, but it is
Taurus' brightest star.

Above Aldebaran a yellower, even brighter
<a href="http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wspace?tbody=6&
vbody=3&month=11&day=17&century=20&decade=0&year=1&hour=00&
minute=0&rfov=30&fovmul=-1&bfov=30">Saturn</a>
is is seen about 1.2
<a href="http://casswww.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/Intro.html">light-hours</a>
from our fair planet.

Last and least
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/asteroid_masses.htm">massive</a>,
one of the faint specks below Aldebaran is
main-belt <a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/
asteroids.html">asteroid</a> Vesta, a mere 13
<a href="http://www.unmuseum.org/speed.htm">light-minutes</a> away.

Still cruising through Taurus,
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/20.html">Vesta</a>
is steadily approaching a
close alignment or <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/
Conjunction.html">conjunction</a> with Saturn on March 19.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/">Viewed from</a> Earth, the
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/features/planets/
planetsfeat.html">solar system's</a> planets do a cosmic
dance that is hard to appreciate on any single night.

But consider this well planned animated sequence
<a href="image/0112/jupsatloop_tezel.jpg">combining 23 pictures</a> taken
at approximately 2 week intervals from June 2000 through May 2001.

It reveals the graceful looping or
<a href="http://alpha.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/
retrograd.html">retrograde motion</a>
of bright
<a href="http://spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/osskids/animate/
mac.html">wanderers</a> Jupiter (leftmost) and Saturn.

Loitering among the background stars are the familiar
Pleiades (above right) and V-shaped Hyades
(below left) <a href="http://hou.lbl.gov/~vhoette/Explorations/
StarHop/hyades_pleiades.html">star clusters</a>.

The planets didn't actually
<a href="ap010601.html">loop</a> by reversing the direction
of their orbits, though.

Their apparent <a href="http://www.scienceu.com/observatory/articles/
retro/retro.html">retrograde motion</a> is a reflection of
<a href="http://faculty.fullerton.edu/cmcconnell/Planets.html">the motion</a>
of the Earth itself.

<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/retrograde/
retrograde.html">Retrograde motion</a>
can be seen each time Earth
<a href="http://www.physics.uci.edu/~wtruppel/
AstroPage.html">overtakes and laps</a>
planets orbiting farther from the Sun, Earth moving more rapidly
through its own relatively close-in orbit.

Astronomer Tunc Tezel captured Jupiter and Saturn's "paired"
retrograde loop in this remarkable series made after the
<a href="ap000505.html">close alignment</a> of these
gas giants in May 2000.

The next opportunity to see these two planets dance such a
pas de deux will be in the year 2020.

searchresult.cfm?aid=12&cid=387&ooid=18425">This artistic 
portrait</a> of <a href="http://www.otenet.gr/everyday/
saturday.html">Saturn</a> depicts how
it might look from <a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/
titan.html">Titan</a>, Saturn's largest moon.

In the foreground sits ESA's
<a href="http://sci.esa.int/home/huygens/index.cfm">Huygens 
probe</a>, which will be released by NASA's 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/spacecraft/">Cassini

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/">Cassini will</a>
reach Saturn in 2004 and release the 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/spacecraft/

<a href="ap000820.html">Titan</a> is one of only two moons in the 
<a href="http://space.jpl.nasa.gov">Solar System</a> to have an atmosphere.

It has been suggested Titan might have gasoline-like lakes
and an atmospheric

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

On September 18, 1997, many stargazers
<a href="ap000708.html">in the U. S.</a> were able to watch a lovely
early morning
<a href="http://www.skypub.com/sights/occultations/occultations.shtml"
>lunar occultation</a> as
<a href="http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/lab/MoonLab.html"
>a bright Moon</a>
passed in front of Saturn.

<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/FLWO/FLWO/48/48.html"
>Using a 1.2 meter reflector</a>, astronomer
Kris Stanek had an
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~kstanek/Saturn/"
>excellent view of this</a> dream-like event from the
<a href="http://linmax.sao.arizona.edu/help/FLWO/whipple.html">Whipple
Observatory</a> atop Arizona's
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/flwo/visitcenter.html">Mount Hopkins</a>.

This animated gif image was constructed by Wes Colley
from 4 frames taken by Stanek
at 35 second intervals as the ringed planet emerged from behind
<a href="ap970916.html">the Moon's</a> dark limb.

<a href="http://www.skypub.com/sights/occultations/lunar/
0101lunarocc.html">While lunar occultations</a> of fairly bright stars
and planets are not extremely rare events, their
<a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm">exact
timing</a> depends critically on the observer's location.

For observers in
<a href="http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/0910sat.htm">western
North America</a>, the Moon will next
occult Saturn on Monday morning,

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Soon it will be winter in Saturn's northern hemisphere.  

Since <a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a> is tilted in its orbit around the 
<a href="http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html">Sun</a>, 
it has 
<a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sseason.htm"
>seasons</a> just like the 
<a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.  

When a hemisphere is tilted so that the 
<a href="ap990923.html">Sun</a> passes more directly overhead, 
summer occurs.  

Half an orbit later -- about 15 (Earth) years for 
<a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> -- winter occurs.  

Since the 
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/saturn.html"
>rings of Saturn</a> orbit the equator, 
they provide a quite graphic seasonal display.  

The <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> 
took the 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2001jun/table.html#facts"
>above sequence</a> of 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/2001jun/display.html"

>Saturn's rings</a> are  
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1984Sci...223..396Z"
>less than 50 meters thick</a> and are composed of

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Forty years ago today (May 25, 1961) U.S. president
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html">John
Kennedy announced</a> the goal of landing Americans on the Moon
by the end of the decade.

Kennedy's ambitious
<a href="http://www.wamu.org/special/moon.html">speech triggered</a>
a nearly unprecedented
peacetime technological mobilization and one result was the
<a href="http://www.hrw.com/science/si-science/earth/spacetravel/
spacerace/SpaceRace/sec300/sec380.html">Saturn V</a> moon
<a href="http://kids.msfc.nasa.gov/Rockets/">rocket</a>.

Its development directed by rocket pioneer Wernher Von Braun,
the three stage
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-3-1.html">Saturn
V stood</a> over 36 stories tall.

It had a cluster of five
<a href="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-000559.html">first
stage</a> engines
<a href="http://users.commkey.net/Braeunig/space/propel.htm">fueled by</a>
liquid oxygen and kerosene which together were
capable of producing 7.5 million pounds of thrust.

Giant Saturn V rockets
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/
contents.html">ultimately hurled</a> nine
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/apollo.html">Apollo missions</a> to the
<a href="http://www.literature.org/authors/verne-jules/
round-the-moon/">Moon and back again</a> with six landing on
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/">the
lunar surface</a>.

The first landing, by
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/
introduction.htm">Apollo 11</a>, occurred on July 20, 1969 achieving
Kennedy's goal.

Bathed in light, this
<a href="http://www.apollosaturn.com/frame-sv.htm">Saturn V</a>
awaits an April 11, 1970 launch on the
third lunar landing mission, <a href="ap010519.html">Apollo 13</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Brilliant Venus <a href="ap990903.html">falls out</a>
of the evening sky as March ends,
but Jupiter and Saturn remain well up above the
western horizon.

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/jupiter/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>
blazes forth above and to the left of a slightly fainter
<a href="ap000212.html">Saturn</a> in this
telephoto picture taken on January 19th.

Near the top lies the lovely <a href="ap000227.html">Pleiades</a>
star cluster with suggestions of its characteristic blue
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/
apod_search?reflection+nebula">reflection nebulae</a>.

These planets and the Pleiades have a similar, easily recognizable
orientation in the Spring night sky.

Also known as
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m045.html">M45</a>,
the 45th object in French astronomer <a href="ap960626.html">Charles
Messier's</a> famous catalog, the Pleiades will likely soon be
checked off many stargazers' tally lists.

For northern hemisphere observers this weekend offers a
prime opportunity to complete a
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/marathon/
marathon.html">Messier Marathon</a> --  the
viewing of all 110 Messier
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/data2.html">catalog
objects</a> in one <a href="ap000311.html">glorious</a>
dusk to dawn observing run.

This weekend it will also be possible to complete an all-planet
marathon, observing all the
<a href="http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/">solar system's</a> planets
in a single night.

And if you still need something to look at, the
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/station/viewing/
issvis.html">International Space Station</a>
could also be visible arcing through the skies depending on
your location, but <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/">Mir will
not</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

From a <a href="ap970829.html">spectacular</a>
vantage point over 1.4 <a href="ap980620.html">billion</a> kilometers
from the sun, the
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html">Voyager</a> 1
spacecraft looked back toward the inner solar system to record
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/
PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA00335">this startling view</a> of Saturn's nightside.

The picture was taken on November 16, 1980, some four days after
the robot spacecraft's closest approach to the
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>gorgeous gas giant</a>.

The crescent planet
<a href="ap000212.html">casts a broad shadow</a> across its bright rings
while the translucent rings themselves can be seen to cast a
shadow on Saturn's <a href="ap951018.html">cloud tops</a>.

Since Earth is closer to the sun than
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>, only Saturn's dayside is visible
to Earth-bound
<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/bigeyes.html">telescopes</a>
which could never take a picture like this one.

After this
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/vgrsat_fs.html"
>successful</a> flyby two decades ago, Voyager 1 has
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/flteam/weekly-rpts/current.html"
>continued outward bound</a> and is presently humanity's most
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Which planet has the most moons?

For now, it's Saturn.

<a href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/
phot-29-00.html">Four newly discovered</a>
satellites bring the ringed planet's
total to twenty-two, just edging out
<a href="ap971103.html">Uranus'</a> twenty-one for
the most
<a href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/
phot-19-00.html">known</a> moons in the solar system.

Of course, the newfound
<a href="http://www.nasm.edu/ceps/etp/saturn/satmoons.html">Saturnian
satellites</a> are not
<a href="ap000820.html">large</a> and
<a href="ap000129.html">photogenic</a>.

The faint S/2000 S 1, the first discovered in the year 2000,
is the tiny dot indicated at the lower right of this
August 7th image made with the ESO 2.2 meter telescope at
<a href="http://www.ls.eso.org/index.html">La Silla, Chile</a>.

(An eye-catching spiral galaxy at the upper left is in
the very distant background!)

Unlike Saturn's larger moons whose almost circular
orbits lie near the planet's equatorial plane,
all four newly discovered moons have
<a href="http://www.obs-nice.fr/gladman/urhome.html">irregular</a>,
skewed orbits drifting far from the planet.

With sizes in the 10 to 50 kilometer range, they are
are likely captured asteroids.

The international team of astronomers involved in the discoveries
hopes to get many observations of
<a href="http://www.obs-nice.fr/saturn/">the tiny satellites</a>
allowing accurate orbital computations before
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/">Saturn is</a>
lost in the solar glare around March 2001.

The team has also found several other irregular satellite
candidates which are now being followed.

Saturn's only previously known irregular satellite is
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/
phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>,
discovered over 100 years ago by W. H. Pickering,

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
The dramatic rotation of the cloud-tops of 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a> every ten-hours is particularly 
evident from orbit around the gas giant planet.  

With a good enough telescope, however, such rotation 
is visible even from Earth, as shown by 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/anim1.html"
>this time-lapse image sequence</a> from the 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> 
taken in November 1990.  

Particularly evident at that time was a 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999Icar..137...24A"
>light-colored giant storm cloud system</a> that
 completely encircled the planet.  

The storm was not evident twenty years ago 
during the flybys of the 
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html"
>Voyager spacecraft</a> -- a storm of this 
magnitude was last noted in 1933.  

Studying the

nearly as massive as gas giant Jupiter or more, in close orbits
around sun-like stars.

Less massive planets must certainly exist, and yesterday
<a href="http://origins.stsci.edu/news/2000/01/
index.html">preeminent planet-finders announced</a> the further
detection of two more new worlds -- each a potentially smaller,
saturn-sized planet. 

The <a href="ap990611.html">parent</a> suns are 79 Ceti
(constellation <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/
constellations/Cetus.html">Cetus</a>), at a distance of 117 light-years, and
HD46375 (constellation <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/
constellations/constellations/Monoceros.html">Monoceros</a>),
109 light-years away.

With at least 70 percent the mass of Saturn, 79 Ceti's planet
<a href="http://origins.stsci.edu/news/2000/01/animations.html">orbits</a>
on average 32.5 million miles from the star compared
to 93 million miles for the Earth-Sun <a href="ap981212.html">distance</a>.

This arresting artist's vision depicts
the newly discovered world with rings and moons,
known characteristics of giant planets
in our solar system.

HD46375's planet is at least 80 percent Saturn's mass,
orbiting only 3.8 million miles from its parent star.

While <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/
factsheet/saturnfact.html">Saturn's</a> mass
is only one third of
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/

100 times that of Earth, and dramatic discoveries

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

From a <a href="ap970829.html">spectacular</a>
vantage point over 1.4 <a href="ap980620.html">billion</a> kilometers
from the sun, the
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html">Voyager</a> 1
spacecraft looked back toward the inner solar system to record
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/
PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA00335">this startling view</a> of Saturn's nightside.

The picture was taken on November 16, 1980, some four days after
the robot spacecraft's closest approach to the
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>gorgeous gas giant</a>.

The crescent planet
<a href="ap000212.html">casts a broad shadow</a> across its bright rings
while the translucent rings themselves can be seen to cast a
shadow on Saturn's <a href="ap951018.html">cloud tops</a>.

Since Earth is closer to the sun than
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>, only Saturn's dayside is visible
to Earth-bound
<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/bigeyes.html">telescopes</a>
which could never take a picture like this one.

After this
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/vgrsat_fs.html"
>successful</a> flyby two decades ago, Voyager 1 has
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/flteam/weekly-rpts/current.html"
>continued outward bound</a> and is presently humanity's most
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/

The next spacecraft to approach Saturn will be 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/">Cassini</a>,
on course to arrive in 2004.

<a href="http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/lab/MoonLab.html"

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

These are not false-color renderings of the latest observations of
<a href="ap980424.html">Saturn's magnificent rings</a>.

Instead, the panels show a strikingly similar
system on a much larger scale -
a ring around the young, Vega-like star,
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/03/b.html"
>HR 4796A</a>, located about 200 light-years from Earth.

Probably composed of dusty debris ground from colliding planetesimals,
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/03/content/9903c.jpg"
>this ring is confined</a> to a zone less than 17 AU wide
(1 AU equals the Earth-Sun distance) and
girdles the star at a radius  of about 70 AU,
roughly twice the orbital radius of Neptune.

In analogy with the relationship
<a href="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/reference/abstracts/cuzzi1984_01.html"
>of Saturn's rings and moons</a>,
this circumstellar ring could be held in place by
forces due to planets - shepherding
planetary bodies or the gravitational influence of larger planets
orbiting closer to the parent star.

In any event, because the ring would not survive long without something
to keep it there, astronomers consider its presence strong
<a href="http://www.generation.net/~mariob/astro/xtrasol.htm"
>evidence for unseen planetary bodies</a> around HR 4796A.

The top panels show
<a href="http://nicmosis.as.arizona.edu:8000/AAS99/hr4796_postrev5.ps"
>the false-color images</a> at two infrared wavelengths
from the Hubble Space Telescope's
<a href="http://nicmos.as.arizona.edu/">NICMOS instrument</a>,
and the bottom panels trace the corresponding image contours.

At the center of each,
the overwhelming light of HR 4796A has been masked
to reveal the fainter circumstellar ring.

was taken on August 6, 1995 when the rings lined up sideways as seen from
<a href="ap970130.html">Earth</a>.  
<a href="lib/saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s largest moon 
<a href="ap950923.html">Titan</a> is seen on the left, and Titan's
shadow can be seen on 
<a href="ap960317.html">Saturn's cloud tops</a>!  
Titan itself looks a brownish color because of its thick atmosphere. Four
other moons of Saturn can be seen just above the ring plane, which are,
from left to right: 
<a href="ap950924.html">Mimas</a>, 
<a href="ap951124.html">Tethys</a>,

carefully, you will note that the dark band across the planet is actually
the <i> shadow </i> of the rings, and is slightly displaced from the real
rings - which are best seen away from the planet.  
<a href="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html">Saturn's

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
The layers of the 
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/38/b5.html">Saturn Nebula</a> 
give a complex picture of how this 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html">planetary nebula</a> 
was created.  The 
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/38/b-js.html">above picture</a>, 
taken in April 1996 and released last week, 
allows a better understanding of the mysterious process that 
transformed a low-mass star into a 
<a href="ap971102.html">white dwarf star</a>.  
A computer model indicates that the central star of 
<a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/n7009.caption.html"
>NGC 7009</a> first expelled the green gas that now appears barrel shaped.  
This green gas now confines stellar winds flowing from the central star, 
creating a jet which forms the 
<a href="ap961122.html">ansae</a> that appear in red at the tips.  
Much remains unknown, including why the gas has not become

yourself into

>the Voyager 2 spacecraft</a> during its
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html"
>visit to the Saturnian System</a> in August of 1981.

Traveling at about 35,000 miles per hour, the spacecraft's changing
viewpoint from one image to the next
produced this exaggerated but pleasing
<a href="ap970404.html">stereo effect</a>.

Saturn is
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>the second largest planet in the Solar System</a>, after Jupiter.

<a href="ap970829.html">Its spectacular ring system</a>
is so wide that it would span the
space between the Earth and Moon.

Although they look solid here,

orbiting bits of ice and rock ranging in size from grains of sand to
barn-sized boulders.

and the corresponding shadow cast across
<a href="ap960429.html">Saturn's rings</a>. 
Since <a href="ap951222.html">Earth</a> is much closer to the

<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm">Saturn</a>, only the day

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

Scheduled for launch in October,
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/">the Cassini spacecraft</a>
will spend
seven years traveling through the Solar System --
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/Science/"
>its destination, Saturn</a>.

On arrival
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/Mission/near.html"
>Cassini will begin</a> an
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/Mission/tour.html"
>ambitious mission of exploration</a> which
will include
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/Mission/probe.html"
>parachuting a probe</a> to the
<a href="ap951021.html">surface of Titan</a>,
<a href="ap960716.html">Saturn's largest moon</a>.

This <a href="http://leonardo.jpl.nasa.gov/art/soi.html"
>artist's vision</a> offers a dramatic view of Cassini's engine firing
during the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver
as it passes above
<a href="ap970524.html">the ring plane</a>.

Before the
<a href="ap960830.html">development of the telescope</a>, the
<a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>gas giant Saturn</a> was the most
<a href="ap960915.html">distant planet known to astronomers</a>.

Ten times farther from the Sun it
receives only 1 percent of the sunlight that Earth does.

Operating in this faint sunlight,
the Cassini spacecraft can't use solar arrays so, like
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html"
>other missions to the outer Solar System</a>, it will be powered by
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/rtg/"
>radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a> (RTGs).

<a href="http://esther.la.asu.edu/asu_tes/TES_Editor/SOLAR_SYST_TOUR/Saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>'s rings are composed of many chunks of ice ranging in size
from a pebble to a car.  The rings have several large gaps, the largest of
which is clearly visible in the picture and is named the

<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/vgrsat.htm">Saturn</a> 
appears brighter than most stars in the sky,
and its rings can be discerned with a small telescope. 
A new spacecraft - 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/">Cassini</a> - will visit 
<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm">Saturn</a>

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sespd/astro.html"
>the Wide Field Planetary Camera-2</a>, the normally bright ring system

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Normally, Earth based astronomers view
<a href="ap950730.html">Saturn's spectacular ring system</a>
fully illuminated by reflected sunlight.
However, this November 1995
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/gif/SatRPC11.txt"
>Hubble Space Telescope composite image</a>
was made to take advantage of an unusual perspective,
with the Sun actually illuminating the rings from below.
The three bright ring features are visible because the rings
themselves are not solid.  Composed of many separate chunks of
rocky, icy material, the rings
allow the scattered sunlight to pass through them -- offering
a dramatic demonstration that they are <i>not</i> continuous,
uninterrupted bands of material.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
This close-up of the tops of 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>'s clouds was taken by the 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mip/voyager.html">Voyager</a> 1
robot spacecraft as it passed the giant planet in November 1980.  
<a href="ap951018.html">Saturn's clouds</a> 
are mostly composed of 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#helium">helium</a> gas, but the small
addition of other elements gives the clouds their colors. These colors have
been computer enhanced in the 
<a href="http://www-pdsimage.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA00025"
>above photograph</a>.  Usually the clouds are
divided into just bands and belt, but the center of this 
photograph shows the addition of
a red oval cloud. The oval's origin remains a mystery, although its color
indicates that its composition is slightly different than surrounding
clouds. A new spacecraft - 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/">Cassini</a> - will visit 
<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm">Saturn</a> 
and is currently scheduled for launch in 1997.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
The third and fourth innermost moons of 
<a href="ap951018.html">Saturn</a> were unexpectedly discovered
to be gravitational "shepards." The inner moon 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/satmoons.html#prometheus"
>Prometheus</a> and the outer moon 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pandora.html"
>Pandora</a> use their gravitational attraction to define 
<a href="ap950730.html">Saturn</a>'s outermost ring.  Were any of the smaller 
chunks of ice and rock that compose Saturn's F Ring to stray, the ring
particle would be gravitationally pulled back into place by one of these
passing moons.  This complex interaction creates a ring structure with two
narrow braids and several unusual knots.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/enceladus.html"
>Enceladus</a> orbits 
<a href="ap951018.html">Saturn</a> between the smaller 
<a href="ap950924.html">Mimas</a> and the larger 
<a href="ap951124.html">Tethys</a>.
Enceladus is composed mostly of water ice and has the cleanest and purest
ice surface in the 
<a href="ap950819.html">Solar System</a>.  It's surface therefore appears 
nearly white. The surface also has many unusual groves and relatively few
craters, like 
<a href="ap951013.html">Jupiter</a>'s moon 
<a href="ap950904.html">Ganymede</a>.  This indicates that the surface is young
and/or newly reformed. To explain this, some astronomers speculate that
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/enceladus.html"
>Enceladus</a> is susceptible to some sort of 
<a href="ap950804.html">volcanic</a> activity.  Enceladus was
originally discovered in 1789 by 
<a href="http://star.arm.ac.uk/history/herschel.html">William Herschel</a>.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/tethys.html"
>Tethys</a> is one of the larger and closer moons of 
<a href="ap951018.html">Saturn</a>. It was visited
by both Voyager spacecraft - Voyager 1 in November 1980 and by Voyager 2 in
August 1981. 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/tethys.html"
>Tethys</a> is now known to be composed almost completely of water
ice.  Tethys shows a large impact crater that nearly circles the planet.  
That the impact that caused this crater did not disrupt the moon is taken 
as evidence that Tethys was not completely frozen in its past.
Tethys has two moons named 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/tethys.html#telesto"
>Telesto</a> and 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/tethys.html#calypso"
>Calypso</a> that orbit just ahead
of it and behind it.  Tethys was originally discovered in 1684 by 
Giovanni Cassini.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
The 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/pubinfo/gif/SatStorm.txt">white wisp</a> 
shown on 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html"
>Saturn</a>'s cloud tops is actually a major storm system only discovered 
in December of 1994.  
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s 
clouds are composed of primarily 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#helium">helium</a>, but the storm's white 
clouds are actually ammonia ice crystals that have frozen upon upheaval to
the top of the atmosphere. The storm may look small but has an extent similar
to the diameter of the 
<a href="ap950622.html">Earth</a>.  This picture is a color composite of 
several taken by the 
<a href="ap950810.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.  
<a href="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/saturn.htm"

<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/iapetus.html"
>Iapetus</a> has an unusual surface, one half of which is very dark, the other 
half very light.  This caused it's discoverer 
<a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#cassini"
>Cassini</a> to remark that 
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/iapetus.html"
>Iapetus</a> could only be seen when on one side of Saturn but not the other.
The reason for the difference between hemispheres is presently unknown.
Iapetus is the third largest of 
<a href="ap950705.html">Saturn</a>'s moon behind 
<a href="ap950923.html">Titan</a> and 
<a href="ap951014.html">Rhea</a>.  Iapetus 
is composed predominantly of water ice.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/rhea.html"
>Rhea</a> is the second largest moon of 
<a href="ap950705.html">Saturn</a>, behind 
<a href="ap950923.html">Titan</a>,
and the largest without an atmosphere.   It is composed mostly of water
ice, but has a small rocky core. 
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/rhea.html">Rhea</a>'s 
rotation and orbit are locked together (just like Earth's Moon)
so that one side always faces Saturn.  A consequence of this is that one
side always leads the other. Rhea's leading surface is much more heavily
cratered than its trailing surface. The above photograph was taken with the
Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1980.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/dione.html"
>Dione</a>, one of 
<a href="ap950705.html">Saturn</a>'s larger moons, is remarkable for its 
bright surface streaks.  These streaks run across some of Dione's many
craters, which indicate that the process which created the streaks occurred
later than the process which created the craters. 
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/dione.html">Dione</a> 
is made of mostly water ice but its relatively high density indicates that
it contains much rock inside. Dione was discovered by Giovanni Cassini in
1684.  NASA's 
<a href="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/cassini.html">Cassini 
mission</a> to Saturn is currently scheduled for launch in
October 1997. Dione's orbit is remarkable it that it also houses the much
smaller moon 
<a href="ap951010.html">Helene</a>.  
This moon, once designated "Dione B", precedes Dione by about 1/6th of an
orbit.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
The largest moon of 
<a href="ap950705.html">Saturn</a> is a rare wonder.  Titan is the only one of
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html"
>Saturn</a>'s moons with an atmosphere, and one of only two moons in the 
<a href="ap950819.html">Solar System</a> with this distinction 
(<a href="ap950817.html">Neptune</a>'s 
<a href="ap950805.html">Triton</a> is the other).  
<a href="http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~cjhamil/SolarSystem/titan.html"
>Titan</a>'s
thick cloudy atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, like 
<a href="ap950622.html">Earth</a>'s, but contains much
higher percentages of "smog-like" chemicals such as methane and ethane.
The smog may be so thick that it actually rains
"gasoline-like" liquids. The organic nature of some of the chemicals found in
Titan's atmosphere cause some to speculate that Titan may harbor life!
Because of its thick cloud cover, however, Titan's actual surface properties
remain mysterious.  
<a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html">Voyager</a> 1
flew by in 1980 taking the above picture,
and recently much has been learned from 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/94/55.html">Hubble Space Telescope 
observations</a>. The
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mip/cassini.html">Cassini mission</a> 
currently scheduled for launch in 1997 will map Titan's
surface, helping to solve some of its mysteries.

The Saturn V rocket was the largest rocket ever used by NASA, and the only

returning them safely.  Saturn V rockets launched all of the Apollo
moon missions, and several to <a href="ap950622.html">Earth</a> orbit as well.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
By watching a star flicker and fade as it passed behind Saturn's rings,
NASA's
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html">Voyager 2 </a>
spacecraft was able explore
the ring system in amazing detail.  Data produced by
Voyager's instruments as the star Delta Scorpii was occulted by
some of the outer rings
was used to reconstruct this image
which shows details almost 1000 times
smaller than normally possible with Voyager's cameras.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Saturn's spectacular system of bright rings has been the subject
of study and wonder since
<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/video/stv/arshtml/arstoc.html"> Galileo </a>
first turned his telescope
on the ringed planet in 1610.  To Galileo, the blurry image produced by
his small telescope was confusing.
Saturn appeared to him to have "ear-like" appendages
which he thought might be large moons.  Eventually, larger telescopes
revealed the incredible truth - Saturn was surrounded by bright rings.
The image above, made by NASA's
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html"> Voyager 2</a>
spacecraft, further reveals the intricate
structure of the ring system.  The image has been computer enhanced and
color coded to bring out the subtle details.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
This image of Saturn was made by NASA's robot spacecraft
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html"> Voyager </a>
2 as it began to explore the Saturn system in 1981.
Saturn's famous rings are visible along with two of its moons, Rhea and
Dione which appear as faint dots in the right and lower right
part of the picture.
Astronomers believe that Saturn's moons play a fundamental
role in sculpting its elaborate ring system.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
This image of Saturn was made in November 1980 by the
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html"> Voyager </a>
1 spacecraft as it flew past the ringed gas giant planet.
From a spectacular vantage point, looking back toward the
inner solar system, the robot spacecraft recorded this
view of the night side of Saturn casting a sharp shadow across
the bright rings.
No Earth based telescope could ever take a similar picture.
Since Earth is closer to the sun than Saturn,
only the day side of the planet is visible from the Earth.
